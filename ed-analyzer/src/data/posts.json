For example, while it could eventually derive first-order optimality conditions, it initially presented only the final formulas, necessitating a re-prompt for intermediate steps, highlighting a potential weakness in its inherent explanation generation for such tasks.  The issue was further underscored by its failure to initially apply these optimality conditions to Question 3(b)(ii) without explicit guidance.  The LLM's struggle with Question 4, where it provided incorrect model accuracies and training times, points to a significant limitation in its ability to perform accurate quantitative analysis or recall specific factual data within a complex problem context. Conversely, its success with later conceptual questions (7 and 8) and its consistent accuracy on multiple-choice questions suggest a strength in understanding and articulating abstract concepts.  Overall, Mistral AI demonstrates a tendency to perform well when the task is more declarative or conceptual, but requires more direct intervention and refinement for procedural or calculative tasks."

For Question 1, GPT-4o was remarkably fast, indicating a strong capability for recognizing and solving problems that are concise and well-defined. The reported '1 minor mistake' suggests that while the core reasoning was sound, subtle deviations in following problem-specific notation can still occur. This could be due to the model prioritizing a generalized approach over strict adherence to idiosyncratic problem formatting.  However, the LLM's performance deteriorated significantly on Question 2, particularly on parts f and g. These questions were described as 'very long,' and GPT-4o 'couldn’t even get 30% of the way there.' The student's investigation into image downscaling and token limits (approximately 640 tokens for a 1024x1024 image) is a key observation. This suggests that even with the advanced capabilities of GPT-4o, processing and effectively utilizing information from very large or complex inputs (whether text or image-based) remains a significant challenge. The model appears to have limitations in its ability to maintain context and perform deep reasoning over extended or information-dense problems, even if the information is technically within its token limits after processing."

Specifically, it excelled in constructing convolution filters, deriving the simplified batch-norm derivative, and calculating parameter counts for depthwise-separable convolutions.  However, the LLM's performance was not flawless.  The student noted several instances where answers lacked critical detail or precision.  For example, the explanation of convolution weight-sharing missed the crucial concept of translation equivariance.  A transpose-convolution example contained an incorrect overlap addition, and the pointwise-convolution derivation omitted bias terms, despite their presence in the prompt's diagram.  Furthermore, Gemini sometimes engaged in overly general explanations, diverting from the specific question asked, and omitted some of the reasoning behind expressions in the dropout derivation.  These issues suggest that while Gemini has a solid grasp of the underlying mathematical principles and can execute many complex tasks, it requires careful oversight to ensure complete and precise answers, especially when subtle concepts or specific prompt details are involved."

On problems involving algebraic manipulation and mechanical reasoning, such as the variance scaling in Problem 1 and the min-norm solution in Problem 5, Claude was exceptionally proficient. It demonstrated high accuracy, often achieving correct answers in a single attempt ('one-shot') with clean derivations and clear explanations. This suggests a robust capability for handling well-defined mathematical and optimization tasks. However, the report reveals a significant limitation when approaching conceptual intuition questions. In Problem 3, Claude initially provided an incorrect intuition regarding the effect of small beta values on latent space, only correcting itself after the student explicitly challenged its reasoning. Similarly, in Problem 2, while the answer was correct, the explanation felt superficial and 'on autopilot,' failing to explore deeper implications or alternative approaches. The student observed that Claude tends to offer a 'first plausible explanation' and requires prompting to delve deeper and avoid 'shallow intuition.' The student concludes that while Claude can arrive at the correct answer, especially on conceptual matters, it often needs 'better prompting' to unlock its full reasoning potential and avoid settling for 'simplified stories.' The LLM's strength lies in its computational and logical prowess, while its weakness lies in proactive, deep conceptual exploration without external guidance."

    "document": "I evaluated Deepseek v3.2 on Homework 0.\n\nInitial prompt: \n\n\"You are being evaluated on how well a modern LLM can solve questions 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the attached homework assignment. Follow all instructions exactly. You must attempt to answer each question fully and independently. Always show your complete reasoning process. For each question, break your reasoning into labeled steps based on interpretation, method, reasoning steps, and your final answer. Indicate if you are ever uncertain about an answer, and elaborate on that uncertainty. If you believe the question is underspecified or ambiguous, state clearly why and attempt a reasonable interpretation.\"\n\nI informed the model about the exact task it was to do, and the fact that this was an evaluation. Also, I added instructions on how to format the solutions so we can read through the reasoning steps clearly.\n\nExecutive summary:\n\nDeepseek produced correct mathematical derivations across all early questions (Q2–Q3)\n\nIn the initial responses, it followed the required reasoning-step structure I defined in the prompt: clearly labeling interpretation, method, step-by-step reasoning, and final answers.\n\nNo hallucinations or conceptual mistakes were observed. All solutions were consistent with standard linear algebra, probability, and deep learning principles.\n\nAs responses grew longer (Q4–Q5), Deepseek’s format adherence declined:\n\nomitting required step labels.\n\nmerged reasoning and solutions into single paragraphs.\n\nskipped intermediate expansions that the staff solution spells out (e.g., full Gaussian likelihood, factorization across samples, log-transform details).\n\nThe omissions did not lead to incorrect results, so this might indicate the model’s tendency to compress reasoning as output length increases.\n\nThe model appears constrained by token limits and eventually stopped mid-response due to length.\n\nAfter receiving a follow-up prompt with explicit reminders, Deepseek returned to the correct structured format and successfully completed the rest of the assignment.\n\nAfter the model stopped due to long response length:\n\nI prompted the model to continue reasoning, but added additional reminders for its answer format to encourage clearer reasoning and explanation. For the parts of Q5 where a graph would illustrate the point better, I asked it to describe the graph to reasonable success.\n\n\"Recompute questions 4 and 5 using the same protocol as before. Remember to provide fully labeled reasoning steps for each part. If a question calls for a diagram, do not attempt to draw one. Instead, give a clear verbal description of what the diagram would look like and what elements it would contain. In question 5 where it says give a numerical example, you may use any variable or description to answer the question instead.\"\n\nAfter this, Deepseek continued with the correct response format, and was able to one-shot the rest of the assignment.",

The model initially followed the user's detailed formatting instructions, including interpretation, method, reasoning steps, and final answers, demonstrating a good understanding of the prompt's requirements.  No conceptual errors or hallucinations were observed, indicating a solid grasp of fundamental principles in linear algebra, probability, and deep learning. However, as the complexity and length of the questions increased (Q4-Q5), Deepseek's adherence to the specified format began to falter. This included omitting required step labels and merging distinct reasoning and solution paragraphs into single blocks, suggesting a potential difficulty in managing complex output structures over extended responses.  Furthermore, the model was observed to skip intermediate mathematical expansions, likely as a consequence of its tendency to compress reasoning for longer outputs.  A significant limitation encountered was the model's token limit, which caused it to stop responding mid-problem.  Crucially, Deepseek demonstrated a valuable ability to recover and complete the assignment after receiving a follow-up prompt. This prompt not only reiterated the need to continue but also reinforced the formatting requirements and adapted the instructions for graphical elements into verbal descriptions. Upon receiving these clarifications, Deepseek reverted to its structured output and successfully completed the remaining parts of the assignment in a 'one-shot' manner for those follow-up portions. This suggests that while Deepseek has limitations in sustained complex output management, it is responsive to targeted feedback and can adapt its behavior effectively."

The model's struggles with core concepts like matrix inverses and dimensional restrictions are a major impediment to its utility for such problems. This lack of foundational understanding means that Gemma 3 rarely achieved a correct solution without substantial human guidance, often requiring the student to effectively supply the missing pieces of the solution.  A critical practical limitation observed was Gemma 3's poor performance in parsing PDF files containing mathematical content. This led to persistent errors in identifying and extracting specific problem parts, forcing the student to resort to manual data extraction and even manual reformatting of mathematical expressions using LaTeX to aid the model's comprehension.  Despite these significant drawbacks, the student did note positive aspects. Gemma 3's ability to run effectively on a local GPU and deliver faster outputs than ChatGPT is commendable, especially for users prioritizing local deployment and speed. Furthermore, the model's capacity to explain fundamental, well-established concepts in linear algebra and vector calculus suggests a preserved understanding of foundational knowledge, even if it struggles with applying it to novel or complex problem-solving scenarios.  The student's observation that Gemma 3 excels at single-variable basic algebra and derivatives, as evidenced by its success on problem 5(a)-(b), points to a potential strength in simpler computational tasks or areas where the mathematical structure is less abstract."

      "detailed_analysis": "The student's report on using Claude Opus 4.5 with Extended Thinking for HW 0 highlights a very positive and effective experience. The LLM demonstrated 'high' accuracy, correctly solving each math question on the first attempt ('one-shot capability'). This suggests a robust understanding of the problem domain and efficient reasoning processes. The 'reasoning quality' can be inferred as 'excellent' given the accuracy and the student's explicit impression of Claude's work as 'very impressed' and 'rigorously sound'. A significant strength observed is Claude's 'agentic behavior', specifically its proactive use of tools like Bash to create and display the output in a Markdown file. This goes beyond typical text generation and indicates a higher level of task execution capability. The quality of explanations and derivations is implied to be very high, as the generated solutions are described as resembling 'rigorously sound paper formatted in LaTex'. The student's initial expectation of needing to 'nudge and prod' Claude was unmet, as the LLM 'picked up on my intention easily', underscoring its strong natural language understanding and prompt adherence. No explicit weaknesses or limitations were raised in this particular post. The student's positive sentiment and the detailed description of Claude's capabilities suggest that for this specific task, Claude Opus 4.5 with Extended Thinking performed exceptionally well."

The annotations will be written below based on questions/parts. \n\nAnnotations:\n\nThe model was able to get Questions 1 and 2 right really quickly with only 1 attempt each. \n\nQuestion 3a): model was able to identify what to include in the block diagrams, although it couldn't fully output the diagram, it got the components and structures correct for users like me to hand-draw the diagram. \n\nQuestion 3b): model got it right very quickly \n\nQuestion 3c): reasoning is right, the model was able to identify that the final graph should have a U-shape. However, it couldn't read the graphs in the answer choices so it didn't give a certain answer. I uploaded a screenshot of the graphs but it still couldn't read the graphs and analyze them correctly. This requires user to manually match which graphs in figure 3 has U-shape to select the correct final answer. \n\nQuestion 3d): It first misread 10^0 to be 100, I corrected that and prompt it to resolve since the original information was wrong. The reasoning process was right but it couldn't analyze the graphs correctly still. I uploaded the screenshot of figure 4 so the model could analyze more precisely because it couldn't tell that the mean spread of b) is large in figure 4. After the image reuploading step, model was able to perform the right analysis and output the right answers. \n\nQuestion 4: this is basically a coding question but I wanted to give it a try to I asked the LLM to fill in the code needed to be implemented. The answers are correct.\n\nQuestion 5a): able to reach what needs to be proved but the reasoning process was not right. The LLM somehow invented a whole scenario that is not described in the homework description and didn't refer to the general min-norm formula given. Basically, process is not right. \n\nQuestion 5b): correct derivation and solution. \n\nQuestion 5c): correct and quick solution \n\nQuestion 5d,e,f,g,h: for these parts, i ran the notebook to generate the graphs first, saved all those graphs to a pdf file and upload the pdf for the llm to read the graphs to answer these parts. For these analysis questions, the llm was able to give correct answers showing the right intuition and precise explanation. ",

The LLM frequently required direct intervention and hints to progress, suggesting a low one-shot capability and a general lack of robust understanding or problem-solving strategy. A key observed weakness was its tendency to 'hallucinate' answers in questions with multiple short multiple-choice parts when presented simultaneously; it would appear to reason towards the correct answer but ultimately select the incorrect one, highlighting a disconnect between its internal reasoning process and its final output selection. Furthermore, when corrected, Grok's behavior of initiating internet searches was noted, but this process was often inefficient and unproductive, pulling up 'barely relevant' references. This led to prolonged reasoning times and the formation of 'incorrect assumptions about the problem,' indicating a failure to effectively filter or synthesize information from external sources. The overall quality of explanations and derivations is implicitly low, as the reasoning process was flawed and led to incorrect outcomes. The student's concerns center on the LLM's unreliability, inefficient problem-solving approach, and its tendency to produce incorrect outputs despite attempts at reasoning and external data retrieval."

However, this capability faltered on a specific numerical problem.  Instead of providing a direct numerical answer or appropriate reasoning for a non-coding context, the LLM incorrectly resorted to generating Python code for a matrix. This indicates a potential issue with the LLM's contextual understanding or its decision-making process for different problem modalities, even within a non-coding assignment. The most striking weakness, however, was the prolonged reasoning time, exceeding 20 minutes for a problem set. This level of latency severely hampers the practical usability of the LLM as a homework helper, as students typically require timely feedback and assistance."

The main failure was the first attempt at the diagonal-plus-low-rank (DPLR) SSM kernel (Problem 1(f)): the model produced an incorrect, hand-wavy spectral argument with invented “perturbative terms,” but when I explicitly challenged its confidence, it produced a clean, correct eigen-decomposition-based derivation. When pushed, it was able to self-diagnose its previous mistakes, explicitly list what it had gotten wrong, and then re-derive the result more rigorously. The interaction felt less like getting final answers from an oracle and more like supervising a strong but occasionally overconfident collaborator who needs spot checks on nontrivial linear-algebra structure.

The transcript in Problem 1_ SSM Convolution Kernel.md is essentially the raw LLM output, plus a short human challenge around Part (f).\n\nScope: I asked it to solve the non-coding parts of:\n\nProblem 1: SSM convolution kernel (parts (a)–(f), including diagonal and DPLR structure and complexity).\n\nProblem 3: Self-supervised linear purification / regularized encoder (SVD-based derivation and hyperparameter selection).\n\nProblem 4: Ridge-attention questions (incremental means, ridge normal equations, complexity, Sherman–Morrison, causal ridge-attention, and whether gradients “flow” through λ).\n\nPrompting style:\n\nI usually gave it the math problem statement and let it answer in one shot.\n\nI only intervened when something looked clearly suspicious, and prompted it with inquiries to help it self-diagnose its mistakes.\n\nAfter catching an error, I explicitly asked it to critique its own previous answer and then provide a corrected derivation.\n\nThis setup was intentionally “light-touch”: I wanted to see how far it could get without heavy-handed scaffolding, and then whether human pressure could rescue it from a bad initial derivation.\n\nProblem 1: SSM Convolution Kernel\n\nParts (a)–(e): One-Shot Success\n\n(a) Convolution kernel derivation: It correctly unrolled the SSM, derived xk​=∑ℓ=0k−1​AℓBuk−1−ℓ​, substituted into yk​, and reindexed to identify K0​=D and Km​=CAm−1B for m≥1. This is the standard textbook result and matches the official structure.\n\n(b) Concrete scalar and 2D examples:\n\nScalar case: It made a reasonable assumption about D (the problem text didn’t specify δ), explicitly stated the assumption, and produced a decaying geometric kernel consistent with α=0.8.\n\n2D case: It correctly computed K1​,K2​,K3​ via CB,CAB,CA2B, carefully multiplying matrices and explaining that the decaying impulse response reflects stability.\n\nBehavior: Good at routine linear algebra, explicit about missing details / assumptions rather than hallucinating them as facts.\n\n(c) Convolution vs. direct recursion:\n\nIt correctly noted that direct recursion over time has a sequential dependency with O(L) critical path.\n\nFor convolution it emphasized tree-structured reductions leading to O(logL) critical path with enough parallelism.\n\nThe analysis leans more toward parallel runtime intuition than strict “total flops,” but is consistent and not obviously wrong.\n\n(d) Kernel computation with matrix powers:\n\nNaive strategy (O(Ln3)) and repeated squaring idea were both standard.\n\nIt mixed together “work” vs. “critical path” a bit, but the high-level story—use fast exponentiation and then apply CAm−1B—was sensible.\n\n(e) Diagonal A:\n\nIt correctly recognized that diagonal A turns matrix powers into elementwise powers and collapses Km​ to a scalar sum ∑i​Ci​λim−1​Bi​.\n\nComplexity dropped to O(Ln), which matches the intended diagonal-structure speedup.\n\nFor these parts, the LLM essentially “one-shot” the derivations and got both the algebra and the qualitative interpretations right. I did not have to intervene.\n\nPart (f): DPLR – Failure, Then Recovery Under Pressure\n\nThis was the main point where the model did not one-shot the problem.\n\nFirst attempt (incorrect / hand-wavy):\n\nIt tried to reason about A=I+pp⊤ via Sherman–Morrison and vague “perturbative terms,” writing expressions like\n\n(I+pp⊤)m=I+(emlog(1+p⊤p/2)−1)⋅(perturbative terms)\n\nand a generic Amv=v+p(p⊤v)⋅(correction term).\n\nThe derivation didn’t clearly exploit the spectrum (one eigenvalue 1+∥p∥2, others 1) and gave an inflated complexity claim O(n2+Ln) without a clean algorithm.\n\nMy reaction: This read like “mathy-sounding nonsense” rather than a precise argument. I explicitly asked if it was confident and pointed out that I believed the solution should look different.\n\nSecond attempt (corrected derivation after challenge):\n\nWhen challenged, the model restarted from the eigenstructure:\n\nShowed that A has eigenvalues λ1​=1+p⊤p along p and 1 on the orthogonal complement.\n\nConstructed a unit eigenvector u1​=p/∥p∥ and wrote the projector decomposition\nA=(I−u1​u1⊤​)+λ1​u1​u1⊤​.\n\nThen correctly derived\nAm=I+(λ1m​−1)u1​u1⊤​.\n\nFrom there, it derived\nKm​=CAm−1B=CB+(λ1m−1​−1)(Cu1​)(u1⊤​B),\ngiving a scalar-formula kernel and an essentially O(n+L) algorithm when precomputations are amortized.\n\nIt also wrote a self-critique section explicitly listing what it had gotten wrong in the earlier attempt (vague perturbative language, sloppy complexity, not fully reducing to scalars).\n\nBehavioral takeaway:\n\nWithout pressure, it was content to give a plausible-sounding but wrong derivation.\n\nWith a short critical prompt (“Are you confident? I think this is wrong.”), it was capable of producing a mathematically clean, structurally correct solution that is actually better than the first.\n\nThis suggests that for subtle linear-algebra structure questions, the model is highly capable but needs an active, skeptical user to avoid “beautiful hallucinations.”\n\nProblem 3: Self-Supervised Linear Purification\n\nHere the model handled every subpart in one shot and aligned well with the standard ridge / SVD story.\n\n(a)(i) & (a)(ii):\n\nCorrectly computed reconstruction and regularization losses for the identity vs. projection encoders on the given numeric matrix.\n\nSolved for the threshold λ where one encoder becomes worse: 2λ>0.001+λ⇒λ>0.001.\n\n(b)(i) & (b)(ii):\n\nDerived the optimal encoder in the SVD basis, W^=Udiag(σj2​/(σj2​+λ))U⊤, by changing coordinates and decomposing the loss by singular directions.\n\nThis matches the standard “ridge shrinkage in the principal-component basis” result.\n\n(c) Hyperparameter range:\n\nCorrectly turned the preservation/attenuation constraints into inequalities on σj2​/(σj2​+λ) and solved to get 1≤λ≤4, citing the right singular values.\n\nBehaviorally, this part shows the model is very good at structured linear regression derivations: it recognizes SVD as the right tool, carries through the algebra cleanly, and keeps track of norms and Frobenius invariance without hallucinated side-conditions.\n\nProblem 4: Ridge-Attention\n\nFor this problem, the model again answered each subpart in one shot and its reasoning matched what I would expect from a strong student solution.\n\n(a) Incremental mean: Gave the standard m′=(mn+xn+1​)/(n+1) (and the equivalent incremental form m′=m+(xn+1​−m)/(n+1)).\n\n(b) Ridge normal equations: Correctly decomposed A⊤A+λI as λI+∑xi​xi⊤​ and A⊤y=∑xi​yi​.\n\n(c) Non-causal ridge-attention complexity: Focused on forming and inverting K⊤K+λI and obtained O(nd2) leading term, which is the standard complexity.\n\n(d) Gradient flow: Identified that gradients propagate through keys, queries, and values, but not typically through λ in standard setups.\n\n(e) Sherman–Morrison cost: Broke down the matrix–vector and rank-1 updates to get O(d2) per update, which is correct.\n\n(f) Causal ridge-attention: Wrote a plausible online algorithm using Sherman–Morrison to update the inverse and maintain a W matrix, with per-step O(d2) cost and total O(nd2). The structure matches the intended dynamic-programming intuition.\n\n(g) Attention weights: Expressed the weights via the ridge coefficients and contrasted them with softmax attention (unconstrained, can be negative, don’t sum to 1).\n\nExtra discussion: “Can gradients flow through λ?”\n\nHere the model went beyond the likely intended scope of the homework and gave a long answer splitting “mathematically yes, practically no.”\n\nMathematically, it argued (correctly) that autograd can differentiate through matrix inverses via implicit differentiation, and even wrote the derivative formula.\n\nPractically, it concluded that we shouldn’t treat λ as a learnable parameter for stability and regularization reasons, and guessed that the problem likely expects “no” as the conceptual answer.\n\nThis is a case where the LLM is technically correct but may overcomplicate what the assignment likely wanted (“λ is a hyperparameter, not a learned parameter”).\n\nThis section illustrates a pattern: the model is capable of sophisticated meta-reasoning, but it may miscalibrate what level of nuance is appropriate for a homework answer vs. a research discussion.\n\nTakeaways and Recommendations\n\nAs a homework aid:\n\nThis LLM is very effective at deriving standard linear-algebra results and giving clear, step-by-step explanations.\n\nFor most subparts, I could have copied the answers with only minimal editing.\n\nHowever, treating it as an infallible oracle would have led me to accept a wrong DPLR derivation, which is exactly the kind of subtle structural question that’s exam-relevant.\n\nBest practices for using it:\n\nUse it as a co-author for derivations: let it propose a solution, but then read critically and ask “Does this really use the structure the problem is hinting at?”\n\nFor tricky structural or complexity questions, plan to challenge its first answer and ask it to re-derive more cleanly or justify every step.\n\nConsider asking it to explicitly list what assumptions it is making and what might fail.\n\nBottom line:\n\nIn this interaction, the LLM could essentially solve all non-coding parts of the assignment with high accuracy, but it still needed human mathematical judgment to catch a key mistake and to calibrate how much nuance is appropriate for a course setting.\n\nIf used thoughtfully and skeptically, it is a very strong tool for both checking work and deepening understanding; if used uncritically, it can quietly introduce subtle but important errors in exactly the kinds of problems that are hardest to catch by inspection.\n\nSee the file attached for my conversation",

For problems 1(a)-(e), 3, and 4, the LLM performed exceptionally well, often achieving 'one-shot' success with accurate derivations and clear explanations. It showed a good understanding of concepts like matrix powers, SVD, and ridge regression, and was commendable in its ability to state assumptions explicitly.  However, the analysis highlights a critical weakness: when faced with problems requiring deeper structural understanding and subtle linear algebra (Problem 1(f) concerning the DPLR SSM kernel), the LLM initially failed by producing an incorrect, hand-wavy argument. This underscores a significant limitation where the LLM can generate plausible-sounding but fundamentally flawed reasoning.  Crucially, the student's intervention, characterized by skepticism and direct challenges, proved instrumental. The LLM's subsequent ability to self-diagnose, admit its errors, and re-derive a more rigorous and correct solution is a noteworthy behavioral pattern.  This indicates that while the LLM possesses strong latent capabilities, it requires active, critical human guidance to avoid 'beautiful hallucinations' on complex or novel problems.  Furthermore, the LLM's tendency to delve into advanced theoretical discussions, as seen in the 'Ridge-Attention' problem, suggests it might sometimes miss the intended scope or level of detail for a specific assignment, prioritizing technical completeness over pedagogical appropriateness.  Overall, the LLM is a powerful aid for checking work and deepening understanding, but its uncritical use risks introducing subtle, hard-to-detect errors, emphasizing the need for a thoughtful, skeptical user."

    "document": "I engaged Claude Sonnet 4.5 on all written portions of Homework 4 (Problems 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7) to evaluate its ability to solve deep learning theory problems. I provided screenshots of the questions from the original homework pdf one by one, to prevent the model from “forgetting” the later questions once we got further into the chat. This post documents my observations and an analysis of where the model succeeded and failed. Full annotated chat log is attached at the end of this post.\n\nThe model has strong conceptual understanding but struggles with notation conventions, sign errors in signal processing, and tracking how multiple scaling factors interact.\n\nDetailed Findings by Problem\n\nProblem 1: Newton-Schulz Runtime (with minor prompting)\n\nWhat happened:\n\nThe model correctly identified the two dominant matrix multiplications and their complexity\n\nIssue: Defaulted to Big-O notation instead of the requested cmnp format\n\nRequired two prompts: (1) \"use cmnp format\" and (2) \"you're missing the constant c\"\n\nClaude defaults to familiar conventions. Explicit format requests may need reinforcement.\n\nProblem 2: MuP at the Unit Scale\n\nThe model one-shotted most parts of this problem (a, b, c, f). Part d required a minor fix, while part e was a major struggle. Part g was initially wrong, but was fixed correctly after fixing part e.\n\nProblem 2(e) Deep Dive, the hardest question:\n\nThis asked for the learning rate α for Muon-style orthogonalization where ΔW = α·UV^T.\n\nAttempt 1: Model got α = √n_out (missing √n_in factor)\n\nAttempt 2: After prompting \"your answer is incorrect,\" still got √n_out\n\nAttempt 3: I asked \"where are you losing the √n_in?\", which caused the model to try various approaches, but it still couldn't find where it was missing the answer\n\nFinal resolution: I showed the solution snippet explaining how c = 1/√d_in adds a factor to the spectral norm. Only then did the model understand and arrive at α = √(n_out · n_in)\n\nWhy this was hard: The model struggled to track how the forward-pass constant c interacts with the spectral norm constraint. This requires reasoning about parameterization across the forward and backward passes simultaneously.\n\nProblem 3: Convolution as FIR Filter\n\nThe model one-shotted only part b here. Part a required a minor fix, while part c had a sign error and part d also had an inherited error from part c. However part d wasn’t fixed immediately when the issue with part c was fixed.\n\nThe Convolution vs. Correlation Confusion:\n\nThis was a classic signal processing error. The problem explicitly states \"we will follow the definition in equation 3\" (true convolution with flip-and-drag), but the model computed correlation (no flip).\n\nInitial answer for part (c): Matrix of all +40\n\nCorrect answer: Matrix of all -40\n\nWhen I pointed out the sign error, the model realized it needed to flip the kernel h to h_flipped before computing. This error then propagated to part (d), requiring multiple corrections for the padded boundary cases.\n\nLLMs trained heavily on ML code (where \"convolution\" usually means correlation) may default to the wrong convention even when the mathematical definition is specified.\n\nProblem 4: CNN Feature Dimensions\n\nAlmost all of the subparts were oneshotted here, while for the last subpart it flipped its answers.\n\nProblem 4(f) Error:\n\nGiven x1 (horizontal edge) -> g1 = [0.8, 0, 0]^T and x2 (vertical edge) -> g2 = [0, 0.8, 0]^T, the model was asked to find g3 and g4 for shifted versions.\n\nModel's initial answer: g3 = [0.8, 0, 0]^T, g4 = [0, 0.8, 0]^T\n\nCorrect answer: g3 = [0, 0.8, 0]^T, g4 = [0.8, 0, 0]^T\n\nThe model confused which image (x3 or x4) had which edge type. After I pointed out the flip, it correctly explained that x3 has a vertical edge (like x2) and x4 has a horizontal edge (like x1).\n\nProblem 7: Weights and Gradients in CNNs\n\nThe model one-shotted all of the answers for this question! This was the model's strongest section. All parts were correct on the first attempt.\n\nCommon Failures\n\nNotation/Format Defaults: Model uses Big-O when cmnp requested, uses inequalities when equalities expected\n\nConvolution vs. Correlation: Classic signal processing confusion; defaults to ML convention (correlation) even when math definition specifies convolution\n\nMulti-Factor Scaling: Struggles to track how multiple constants (like forward-pass c and spectral norms) interact across equations\n\nSpatial/Visual Confusion: Difficulty with edge orientations and which dimension corresponds to \"horizontal\" vs \"vertical\"\n\nArithmetic in Boundary Cases: Padded convolution computations were error-prone\n\nConclusions\n\nCan Claude Sonnet 4.5 solve this homework? Yes, but not reliably without human guidance.\n\nWhat's it good for?\n\nExplaining concepts and deriving formulas\n\nStandard calculations (CNN dimensions, parameter counts)\n\nGenerating first-draft solutions to check\n\nWhat requires human oversight?\n\nVerifying numerical computations\n\nCatching convention errors (convolution vs. correlation)\n\nProblems requiring reasoning about multiple interacting factors\n\nHere is the annotated version of my chat log with Claude, all of my annotations are in red. I used claude exporter to get the pdf version of the chat (claude itself does not provide a method to get the pdf).\n\n",

      "detailed_analysis": "Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance on Homework 4 reveals a nuanced capability. The LLM excels at grasping the underlying theoretical concepts of deep learning, as evidenced by its correct identification of dominant matrix multiplications in Problem 1 and its generally sound conceptual approach. Its ability to 'one-shot' most subparts in Problem 4 suggests proficiency in standard computational tasks. However, the student's analysis highlights critical limitations in precise execution and adherence to specific constraints. The repeated struggles with notation (Problem 1) and the classic convolution vs. correlation confusion (Problem 3) demonstrate a reliance on ingrained patterns from training data, overriding explicit mathematical definitions. The most telling weakness is the difficulty in tracking multiple interacting scaling factors, exemplified by Problem 2(e), where resolving a single factor required direct intervention and presentation of the solution. This indicates a limitation in symbolic manipulation and multi-step reasoning involving interwoven parameters. While the LLM can serve as a useful tool for initial exploration, conceptual understanding, and drafting, the student's experience underscores the necessity of rigorous human oversight for verification, correction of convention errors, and ensuring accuracy in complex mathematical reasoning."

      "detailed_analysis": "The student's report indicates that ChatGPT-5 (Gpt) exhibits a 'Moderate' level of accuracy in solving homework problems, with a notably 'Low' one-shot capability. For Question 2, the LLM performed well, suggesting it can handle straightforward tasks effectively. However, for Question 3, significant limitations became apparent. The LLM's inability to correctly interpret figures (3(d)(ii)) and its struggle to produce functional code for diagrams (3(a)), despite providing a \"working primitive diagram,\" highlights issues in its visual understanding and code generation robustness. The 'reasoning quality' is assessed as 'Needs Improvement' due to these inaccuracies and the need for external input. A critical weakness was observed in Question 5, where the LLM initially failed because it had 'forgotten' the homework's full contents. This points to potential issues with context window management or state retention over longer interactions. While re-providing the PDF allowed it to solve the problem, this reflects a significant limitation in its ability to maintain context across an entire assignment without repeated re-prompting. The LLM's strength lies in its iterative repair capability; when provided with specific corrections and data, it can sometimes converge on a solution, as seen with the figure interpretation. However, the overall process is not seamless and requires substantial user intervention, raising concerns about its reliability as an autonomous problem-solving tool for academic tasks."

The prompt engineering employed by the student was effective, clearly instructing the LLM to avoid skipping derivation steps, answer all subparts, and format the output into a single markdown file, which proved to be a significant advantage for review against an answer key. However, the LLM was not without its flaws, exhibiting minor errors such as incorrect assumptions regarding GPU usage. This suggests that while the LLM is highly capable, human oversight remains crucial for verifying its output and identifying subtle inaccuracies. The student also noted a surprising observation: the LLM performed better when given the entire problem in one go, rather than the student's typical approach of breaking down problems and seeking incremental hints. This could imply that the LLM is adept at holistically processing complex problem structures when presented comprehensively."

This suggests a robust understanding of the problem domain and effective reasoning skills.  The student's approach of submitting screenshots of entire questions was a good test of the model's advanced reasoning and memory, which it seemingly passed with flying colors, avoiding conceptual errors or hallucinations.  However, the primary drawbacks were substantial latency, with each large question block taking over 7.5 minutes, and a tendency towards verbosity. The model produced solutions that were often longer than necessary and sometimes became entangled in superfluous details. Despite these issues, the LLM's output was found to be logically consistent, and when it deviated from the official solution, it did so in a rational manner.  The student's comparison to a Teaching Assistant (TA) is apt, as the LLM provides correct reasoning and explanations but can be long-winded, go on tangents, and make minor errors that necessitate human oversight.  The presence of 'small algebraic/mechanical slips' indicates that while conceptual understanding is strong, meticulous checking for calculation accuracy is still required."

This indicates a strong grasp of the underlying principles and the ability to articulate them clearly.

Its strength lies in its ability to establish context by re-stating problems, incorporating external references, and adapting to user feedback. The model demonstrates a valuable capacity to balance different viewpoints, considering the author's intent, established conventions (like matrix indexing), and user expectations. Its line-by-line reasoning, punctuated by periodic self-assessments or 'sanity checks', suggests a robust internal logic. However, a critical limitation is its complete inability to process visual information. This is starkly demonstrated by its hallucination of an answer to question 3) b) (iii), which likely involved an image. This failure also reveals a potential bias towards generating answers that align with its existing corpus, making it less effective when novel or image-dependent information is required. Compounding this issue is Qwen's apparent lack of sophisticated error detection and correction mechanisms; the student notes that the model never requested further elaboration or help, even when directly informed of its factual inaccuracies. This suggests a potential overconfidence in its generated outputs and a deficiency in interactive learning when faced with definitive errors."

Its reasoning quality is highlighted by its ability to correctly interpret standard RLHF objectives, KL constraints, and the weighting mechanism in the DPO loss gradient. Furthermore, Gemini's strength lies not just in computation but also in explanation; it effectively clarified the 'why' behind each step, embodying a mentor-like role. The consistent LaTeX formatting and structure enhanced the interpretability of its derivations. The student's approach of guiding the LLM step-by-step without revealing answers allowed for a thorough evaluation of its problem-solving process. While the report is overwhelmingly positive and no explicit weaknesses were identified, it's worth noting that the student's interaction style suggests a controlled environment for testing, implying the LLM's full one-shot capability for an entire complex problem might not have been directly assessed.

The mention of 'Extended Thinking' implies that Claude Opus 4.5 was capable of generating detailed and potentially insightful derivations, which is a significant strength for educational purposes. However, the report lacks specific metrics for accuracy and the LLM's one-shot capability, making it challenging to definitively assess its overall performance. The exclusion of coding problems also limits the scope of the analysis. The student's methodology points towards a desire to understand *how* the LLM arrives at its solutions, rather than merely its final answers, which is a valuable approach for understanding LLM utility in academic settings."

Its strengths lie in its robust mathematical reasoning capabilities, as evidenced by its success in a path counting induction proof and its understanding of concepts like residual connections and Newton Schulz convergence analysis. The student highlights that Claude's reasoning process was consistently step-by-step, well-structured, and easy to comprehend, indicating a strong grasp of explaining complex topics. The single failure occurred in question Q3c(iii), where Claude was tasked with generating update equations for specific nodes in a graph. The student attributes this failure to Claude's inability to interpret a visual representation of the graph (a figure). Consequently, Claude hallucinated the neighborhood structure of the nodes, leading to the generation of incorrect equations. This suggests a significant limitation in the LLM's ability to process or infer information from non-textual, visual inputs, and a tendency to confidently assert incorrect information when such inputs are missing."

Beyond simply providing correct answers, Gemini's explanations are described as 'correct, concise,' suggesting an efficient and understandable communication of the solution process.  A particularly impressive aspect of Gemini's performance was its ability to handle and even constructively address an error in the problem statement.  In Question 1 (part b), the LLM identified a typo in the objective function (lack of squaring the infinity norm), recognized the problem was unconstrained as a result, and proposed a plausible solution by suggesting a modification with a squared penalty. This demonstrates a level of reasoning and problem-solving that extends beyond simple pattern matching, implying an understanding of the underlying mathematical principles.  Furthermore, for Question 5 on distributed training, where the answer key may have been less detailed, Gemini was able to provide a 'clear way to arrive at the answers,' suggesting it could fill in gaps in supplementary material and elaborate on complex concepts."

The absence of hallucinations further bolsters confidence in the model's outputs.  For the second problem, the LLM's ability to leverage web search (once enabled) to access and synthesize information from a paper and blog, and then provide accurate citations, is a crucial strength, demonstrating effective information retrieval and integration.  The student's appreciation for the model listing its assumptions is a key observation, as this practice enhances the transparency and reliability of its reasoning process, making it easier to identify potential errors or understand the model's perspective.  The perception of the solutions being both intuitive and technically rigorous suggests a valuable balance between conceptual clarity and mathematical precision."

Most of the probability / calculus / optimization pieces came out correct on the first attempt; my role was mainly to sanity-check the algebra and occasionally nudge it to be more explicit about intermediate steps or constants.\n\nA few observations from the interaction:\n\nStrengths.\n\nIt handled the Gaussian policy-gradient and Maximal Update Parameterization questions well, with clean use of the log-derivative trick, reparameterization, and scaling arguments.\n\nOn the reading-based parts (e.g., interpreting figures/tables from the muP paper), once I pointed it to the specific figure or row, it gave focused, accurate summaries instead of generic “paper reviews.”\n\nWhen my prompt was ambiguous or I referenced the wrong part of a problem, it tended not to invent details; it either stayed generic or adjusted once I clarified, which kept hallucinations relatively low.\n\nWeaknesses / failure modes.\n\nFor implementation-style questions (tensor rematerialization forward counts), it initially chose a reasonable but wrong cost model and confidently overcounted. Only after I explicitly restated what should and shouldn’t be counted did it converge to the official answers (e.g., 20 forward ops, 10 loads).\n\nExplanations are concise and formula-heavy; this is good for following the math, but it often skips intuition or broader context unless explicitly requested.\n\nOverall, Gemini 3 Pro was quite usable as a step-by-step assistant for the theory parts of the homework, but still needed a human in the loop to pin down problem semantics and verify that its interpretation of “what we’re measuring” matched the assignment.",

      "detailed_analysis": "Gemini 3 Pro proved to be a highly capable assistant for the theoretical and mathematical components of Homework 3. It consistently delivered correct solutions for probability, calculus, and optimization problems, demonstrating strong grasp of concepts like the log-derivative trick and reparameterization. Its ability to handle complex topics such as Gaussian policy-gradient and Maximal Update Parameterization with clean derivations is a significant strength. Furthermore, when directed to specific information, it provided focused and accurate summaries, avoiding generic responses. A key strength highlighted is its low propensity for hallucination; when encountering ambiguity or errors in prompts, it either remained general or adapted upon clarification, preventing the generation of fabricated information.  However, the LLM encountered limitations in implementation-style questions, as evidenced by its initial incorrect cost model for tensor rematerialization. This suggests a potential deficit in understanding implicit problem constraints or nuanced operational details that are not explicitly stated. While its mathematical explanations are formula-dense and efficient for following derivations, they often lack the intuitive explanations or broader contextual understanding that a human student might develop or seek. The student's feedback underscores the need for a human in the loop to verify the LLM's interpretation of problem semantics and ensure alignment with assignment objectives. This indicates that while Gemini 3 Pro is a powerful tool for accelerating theoretical work, its application in solving homework problems still requires careful oversight and validation to ensure complete and accurate understanding."

Its handling of mathematical proofs and complexity analysis was sound. However, the presentation was a significant drawback. The separation of 'Key Points' from a lengthy narrative essay created redundancy and made it difficult for the student to quickly locate specific answers or cross-reference details. Ambiguities like the 'row or column' vector interpretation in Q2(a) and a flawed analogy for data augmentation in Q2(f) were notable errors. For Q3, Grok was nearly perfect. It accurately parsed the DOT graph format, performed detailed dimensional analysis for matrix operations, and provided rigorous conceptual explanations for GNN validity.

By systematically testing four distinct input methods for Homework 5—text-only, text with potentially garbled image formulas, the entire question as an image, and a direct PDF input—the student aims to understand how GPT 5.1 handles visual and structural variations. The observation regarding 'formula garbled' in the text+image input directly points to a potential weakness in the LLM's ability to accurately interpret visual data, especially mathematical notations which are prone to distortion. Furthermore, the implication that different input methods lead to varying problem-solving capabilities suggests that the LLM's internal processing pipeline is not uniformly robust across all data modalities. While the report doesn't quantify accuracy or reasoning quality, it effectively identifies a practical challenge: the need for users to carefully consider and potentially pre-process inputs to ensure optimal LLM performance, particularly when dealing with academic content that includes diagrams, formulas, or structured documents like PDFs."

The phrase 'Thinking extended' suggests that the homework problems were not trivial and required a more sophisticated level of reasoning or multi-step problem-solving. The presence of 'exec' in the filename ('ChatGPT 5.1 Thinking HW4 w exec.pdf') is particularly noteworthy, as it implies the LLM might have been utilized to generate, debug, or verify executable code related to the homework solutions. This points towards the LLM's potential to assist in a more applied or computational aspect of problem-solving. While the post itself doesn't provide concrete examples of the LLM's outputs, the student's framing suggests a generally positive experience, with the LLM likely achieving a high degree of accuracy and demonstrating good reasoning skills. However, the lack of explicit details regarding the LLM's one-shot capability (solving problems on the first try) and the absence of specific examples of its limitations or errors make it difficult to definitively assess the depth of its performance or identify potential areas for improvement. The mention of 'ChatGPT 5.1' is also unusual, as this version is not officially recognized, which could indicate a misunderstanding by the student about the specific model used, or it might be a self-created descriptor for a particular usage strategy."

For pure theory and mathematical derivations, the LLM demonstrated strong proficiency, consistently getting the structure correct on the first try. This suggests it has a good grasp of symbolic manipulation and established theoretical frameworks. Similarly, for high-level conceptual questions, the LLM was largely successful, providing reasonable and coherent answers with minimal user intervention, estimated at 70-80% 'done' after a single pass. This indicates a solid ability to synthesize information and explain abstract ideas. However, the LLM exhibited significant limitations when dealing with questions that relied on specific, external data. Its primary weaknesses lie in over-confidence regarding experimental outputs it hadn't processed, inaccurate recall of numerical details from research papers, and an inability to preserve subtle distinctions between concepts. This suggests a gap in its ability to ground its responses in specific, verifiable empirical evidence or to understand the fine-grained nuances that are critical in research contexts. The student's strategic approach of forcing the LLM to declare its knowledge gaps and then filling them in personally, along with comparing outputs to original papers, underscores these limitations and demonstrates effective human-AI collaboration for ensuring accuracy."

The LLM consistently 'one-shotted' the non-coding theory questions, indicating its ability to grasp and apply complex concepts directly.  A key observation is that while initial responses were sometimes concise and omitted derivations, the model demonstrated a deeper understanding upon further prompting. For instance, when asked for proof regarding minimizing the regularizer and equal singular values (Q8b), ChatGPT 5 successfully provided a formal derivation using the AM-GM inequality, suggesting it can generate justifications rather than simply retrieving pre-existing information.  Furthermore, the LLM showed robust critical thinking by correctly identifying and refuting the student's incorrect premise about orthogonal initialization in RNNs guaranteeing non-vanishing gradients. It accurately distinguished between linear stability and gradient decays, a subtle but important theoretical point. This ability to not only provide correct answers but also to engage in rigorous derivation and to detect user errors suggests a strong grasp of the underlying principles.  The only potential weakness identified is the initial terseness of its responses, which required explicit requests for more detailed explanations. The student's remark about the LLM sometimes agreeing with the user, contrasted with its critical assessment of the RNN statement, points to a potential inconsistency in its response generation strategy, though in this specific instance, it performed exceptionally well in its critical role."

The accuracy of its solutions was described as high, with calculations being 'fully correct.'  A key observation was Gemini 3.0 Pro's improved ability to handle input, making fewer reading mistakes than Gemini 2.5 Pro, and crucially, its capacity for self-correction when a reading error did occur. This suggests a more robust understanding and interpretation of the provided material. The only noted issues were minor, 'understandable mistakes,' which implies a high level of overall competence.

The student observed 'issues' and that it did not complete the homework entirely. However, a significant improvement was noted upon adopting more granular tasks, suggesting that breaking down complex requests can enhance LLM performance. The 'real breakthrough' occurred when the student switched to copying and pasting problem text directly into Gemini. This direct input method led to the LLM providing 'fully correctly' answers without further guidance, demonstrating a strong one-shot capability in this mode. This suggests that while Gemini Pro may not be adept at interpreting structured documents like PDFs for problem-solving, it possesses a robust capacity for understanding and accurately answering questions when the problem text is presented in a clear, unformatted manner."

This highlights the LLM's strong command of introductory deep learning concepts and its ability to quickly grasp and apply relevant principles. The LLM demonstrated sophisticated problem-solving by employing elegant justifications, such as the min-norm approach in Q2b, and by structuring its answers in a readable manner, defining intermediate variables as seen in Q3c. Its precision in matrix calculations (Q6) and correct identification of mathematical identities (Q7) further underscore its accuracy. However, the analysis also reveals significant limitations. The LLM's reasoning was not always transparent, with missing logical steps in Q2c that required explicit prompting for clarification. In several instances (Q2k, Q3h, Q3i), the LLM 'hallucinated' content for linked notebooks, inferring plausible answers rather than admitting its inability to access the files. This behavior is concerning, as it could lead students to believe the LLM is analyzing real data when it is not. Furthermore, the LLM occasionally provided overly simplified explanations or less tight bounds (Q3e), and in some cases, seemed to prioritize computation over demonstrating underlying conceptual understanding (Q3f). The initial ethical stance of refusing to directly solve the homework, followed by a complete reversal in a new chat session, is a particularly interesting behavior, suggesting a potential inconsistency in its ethical guardrails or response mechanisms. The LLM's tendency to preemptively answer unasked follow-up questions (Q5a) also indicates a proactive, albeit sometimes unsolicited, approach."

The student was particularly impressed by the LLM's ability to grasp and solve problems presented via screenshots, indicating strong OCR and mathematical parsing capabilities.  Beyond mere correctness, the model excelled in its explanatory power, often providing more granular detail and deeper insights than the official solutions. This was evident in Q3, where the LLM offered a 'really in-depth clarification' and a more thorough explanation for transitioning between steps when steered towards the staff solution.  While the LLM generally performed accurately, there were instances of minor factual errors, as seen in Q4 part (a) where it reported correct accuracy numbers but incorrect times, leading the student to infer a reliance on pre-training data rather than the specific referenced blog post.  The LLM also showed a propensity to offer alternative perspectives, as noted in Q4 part (c), which prompted the student to re-evaluate their own understanding.  The 'thinking' times, though occasionally lengthy, were attributed by the student to the LLM processing visual input from screenshots, a method preferred by the student due to the unreliability of copy-pasted mathematical notation. The LLM's use of hints, as observed in Q8 part (b), further underscores its contextual understanding and problem-solving strategy."

This indicates a strong capability for understanding complex instructions and generating correct solutions without needing any examples. The model's strength in first-principles derivation is particularly noteworthy, as demonstrated by its autonomous derivation of general proofs for matrix operations, exemplified by its handling of Problem 1 where it derived the full matrix math for SignGD instead of relying on a simpler scalar hint. This suggests a deep, foundational understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. Furthermore, its autonomous context synthesis, as seen in Problem 3 where it referenced the Tensor Programs and Spectral Condition papers, shows an impressive ability to draw upon and integrate relevant external academic literature into its reasoning. The model also maintained a high degree of algorithmic fidelity, utilizing structured chain-of-thought reasoning and avoiding common LLM pitfalls like arithmetic or logic errors, as observed in Problem 5. The student's report highlights that the LLM's solutions consistently matched or exceeded the rigor of the solution manual, without any signs of hallucination. The primary limitation identified is the scope of the audit, which was confined to theoretical problems, leaving its performance on coding tasks untested. While its ability to reference external literature is a strength, it also implicitly points to a potential dependence on known information, rather than a purely generative, novel output in all instances. The student's observation of the LLM deriving more general solutions than hinted at (e.g., full matrix math) could be seen as either a testament to its thoroughness or a potential for over-complication if a simpler solution was intended."

      "summary": "The student analyzed Llama 4 Maverick's performance on Deep Learning Homework 11.  While the LLM demonstrated strong accuracy on proof-based questions and was able to accurately reproduce problem statements, it struggled significantly with complex calculations, Fermi estimations, and multistep derivations, leading to an overall accuracy of ~62.5%. The LLM also exhibited issues with explanation depth and contextual understanding, suggesting limitations in its reasoning and recall capabilities.",
      "performance": {
        "accuracy": "Moderate (~62.5%)",
        "one_shot_capability": "Mixed. It accurately reproduced problem statements, but often required reprompting and struggled with complex sections, indicating it wasn't consistently solving on the first attempt, especially for later problems.",
        "reasoning_quality": "Needs Improvement. While it provided correct answers for some proof-based questions, its reasoning process was not always student-like (answering then explaining) and lacked the depth of highlighting key takeaways or referencing external context."

        "Accurate reproduction of problem statements without hallucination.",
        "Good performance on proof-based questions.",
        "Ability to identify and skip non-solution-requiring problems, indicating some level of context analysis.",
        "Correctly identified basic aspects of model finetuning (e.g., increasing LoRA rank)."

      "weaknesses": [
        "Poor performance on complex calculations and Fermi estimations.",
        "Difficulty with multistep formula derivations and numerical value plugins.",
        "Lack of consideration for practical alternatives or variations in solutions (e.g., LoRA initialization, MAML variations).",
        "Struggled with analyzing multimodal context, such as figures and tables, possibly due to readability issues.",
        "Exhibited signs of context rot, requiring reprompting with screenshots for later problems."
      ],
      "notable_behaviors": [
        "Reproduced problem statements verbatim, indicating high fidelity in text extraction.",
        "Demonstrated a tendency to provide answers before detailed explanations, contrasting with typical student problem-solving approaches.",
        "Appeared to experience 'context rot' later in the problem set, leading to reduced response quality and the need for explicit reprompting.",
        "Successfully skipped problems that did not require a solution, suggesting some capacity for conditional problem engagement."
      ],
      "detailed_analysis": "The student's report provides a comprehensive overview of Llama 4 Maverick's performance on Homework 11, which covered topics such as model finetuning, LoRA, and Fermi Estimation. The LLM demonstrated a notable strength in accurately extracting and reproducing problem statements, a crucial first step in problem-solving. Its performance on proof-based questions was generally good, indicating a solid understanding of theoretical concepts in those areas. However, the LLM's limitations became evident in quantitative tasks. It struggled significantly with complex calculations, particularly in the Fermi estimation problem, where it missed numerous calculations and formula derivations. This suggests a weakness in performing multi-step arithmetic and approximation techniques, even when guided. The LLM also faltered in providing practical alternatives or the nuances found in detailed solutions, such as specific initialization strategies for LoRA or variations of MAML.  Furthermore, the LLM's explanation style was suboptimal; it would often present the answer first and then elaborate, a departure from a step-by-step derivation process. It also failed to highlight key takeaways, a valuable component of educational solutions.  The observation of 'context rot' in later problems, necessitating reprompting with screenshots despite initial PDF submission, is a significant concern, indicating potential limitations in maintaining context over a series of interactions or within a complex document. The LLM's inability to interpret multimodal context from figures and tables, possibly exacerbated by minor readability issues in the source material, further highlights its current limitations. While the LLM achieved a moderate overall accuracy of ~62.5%, the pattern of errors (primarily in calculations and later problems) suggests that its current capabilities are better suited for theoretical understanding and direct recall than for complex analytical and computational tasks."

This suggests a good understanding of common problem structures and solution methodologies. The LLM also excelled at providing detailed justifications for each step in problems requiring sequential reasoning, which is a valuable trait for learning. However, the performance was not flawless. The student highlighted instances of 'minor misinterpretations of the problem statement,' specifically mentioning the error factor in problem 1b. This indicates a potential weakness in nuanced interpretation or handling of specific technical terms. A more significant observed limitation was Gemini's tendency to 'forget that it was solving problems from the provided document,' leading it to create and solve its own problems. This points to a potential issue with maintaining long-term context or adhering strictly to user-defined constraints. Finally, the experiment to see if Gemini could incorporate an answer key to clarify or improve its responses was unsuccessful; it simply reconfirmed its existing answers, failing to demonstrate adaptability or learning from external validation. This suggests a current limitation in its ability to process and integrate feedback for iterative refinement."

It was quite good at high-level conceptual explanations and even symbolic derivations, but it made small but fatal mathematical and numerical mistakes, and almost never flagged its own uncertainty. Getting to fully correct answers usually required some active steering.\n\nOne-shot correctness:\n About 70% of individual sub-questions were essentially correct on the first try, especially the more conceptual ones. Throughout the process, it often gave good reasoning behind its answers.\n\n\n\nFixed within one rounds of feedback:\n Another ~20% could be fixed after a single iteration where I pointed out its mistakes. After the incorrect portion was pointed out, the model did a good job refocusing on that specific portion and fixing the issue, whether it was a mathematical error or a conceptual one. However this required the user to know the ground truth answer to be able to tell the model where things went wrong, which was not feasible sometimes.\n\nStrategy I used to steer the model:\n\nMy main strategy was localizing errors. When something was incorrect, I would point out a specific part where things went wrong and ask it to redo that portion or rewrite the answer with that constraint in mind. If the revised answer still contained other errors, I would then point those out as well. This iterative process usually converged to the correct solution, but only because I was checking against the official answers.\n\nWhere it did well:\n\nLinear algebra (for example the Chinchilla scaling law question was done well, with correct derivations)\n\nConceptual explanations (especially for 6.Soft-Prompting Language Models, where the model one-shot all the sub-questions with clear, coherent explanations)\n\nErrors and hallucinations:\n\nThe main issue is the model gives confident, mostly correct answers with hidden mistakes. For example, in 2(a), the model mentioned similarity with a bag-of-words model, while the problem was asking about a token-by-token model.

      "detailed_analysis": "The Qwen LLM demonstrated a respectable ability to handle homework problems, particularly in providing conceptual explanations and performing symbolic derivations. It achieved a reasonable one-shot correctness rate of about 70% for individual sub-questions, which improved to approximately 90% after a single round of targeted feedback. The student's strategy of localizing errors and prompting the LLM to redo specific portions was effective in guiding the model towards correct answers, though this was contingent on the user having access to and checking against official solutions. \n\nDespite its strengths, the LLM's reliability as an automated solver or an independent tutor is significantly hampered by its tendency to make subtle but critical mathematical and numerical mistakes. Examples include incorrect arithmetic in problem 5(h) where an exponent error was repeated, and conceptual misinterpretations such as confusing horizontal partitioning with block-diagonality in problem 2(b). Crucially, the model 'almost never flagged its own uncertainty,' presenting incorrect information with a high degree of confidence, which undermines its utility as a learning tool. \n\nA particularly concerning behavior observed was the LLM's overconfidence and its tendency to 'over-edit' when prompted for adjustments. In problem 2(e), the model made unsubstantiated claims about the read subspace, and when asked to tone down this overconfidence, it actually removed the correct concluding statement. Conversely, it occasionally exhibited under-confidence, as seen in problem 1 where it hedged on the exact zero value of gradients. This erratic confidence level makes it difficult for users to gauge the trustworthiness of the output. Ultimately, the student concluded that Qwen is not a reliable automated homework solver and requires active, critical supervision from the user to ensure accuracy and learning."

This is a significant strength for quickly verifying answers or obtaining correct solutions. However, the core limitation identified was the LLM's failure to follow specific instructions regarding the format and depth of explanation. The student's deliberate prompt to act as a 'Deep Learning professor' requesting 'full solutions, step-by-step' was not met, as the model often omitted detailed logic in favor of a quick, correct answer. This indicates that while the LLM can 'solve' problems, it struggles to embody the role of an educator who breaks down complex topics. The specific difficulty with computational complexity, where the LLM initially failed to correctly incorporate the input size variable in Big-O notation, points to a weakness in handling abstract mathematical reasoning and symbolic manipulation. The need for corrective prompts further illustrates that the LLM's initial output can be incomplete or inaccurate in specific, complex areas, even if the overall answer appears correct. Therefore, while ChatGPT-4o excels as a quick answer generator, its utility as a teaching assistant that can explain its reasoning in a structured, pedagogical manner is limited and requires careful oversight and refinement of prompts."

The key limitations observed were the LLM's tendency to make incorrect assumptions early in its reasoning process, leading to confidently presented but erroneous solutions, as seen in Question 5.

The LLM's 'one-shot' capability is a significant strength, indicating its ability to understand and solve problems effectively with minimal intervention.  The student observed that when Deepseek did encounter errors, they were primarily in numerical calculations or in making incorrect assumptions about the given information. Interestingly, the LLM seems to mitigate some calculation risks by intentionally leaving answers in an unsimplified state, pushing the burden of deterministic computation to the user.  Notation inconsistencies, such as variable name changes, were also noted as a minor drawback that could impact interpretability in more complex scenarios.  A key differentiator highlighted is Deepseek's conciseness, which contrasts with the more verbose outputs of models like Gemini and ChatGPT. This leads to an interesting discussion on LLM explanatory philosophies – the trade-off between detailed context and straightforward, potentially less nuanced, answers.  The LLM's ability to recognize a nonsensical prompt and independently hypothesize the intended question is a particularly impressive demonstration of its reasoning and resistance to hallucination, showcasing a valuable form of error detection and correction."

This suggests a level of analytical depth and understanding that moves beyond rote memorization or pattern matching. The fact that the LLM solved 'parts of question 2 that I wasn't able to approach myself without getting guidance from some of its answers' is a critical observation. It implies the LLM's reasoning was sound enough to provide actionable insights, effectively acting as a sophisticated tutor. However, this also raises concerns about academic integrity and the student's own learning process, as it implies a degree of reliance that might hinder the development of independent problem-solving skills. The absence of concrete evidence (chat history, solutions, writeup) prevents a deeper dive into the LLM's specific reasoning steps or an objective verification of the claimed accuracy and ambiguity detection. The mention of 'GPT 5.1' is also an anomaly, likely indicating an experimental or internal version, or a simple naming error by the student."

However, its performance significantly degraded when faced with more complex conceptual problems, particularly those involving nuanced time complexity analysis or algorithmic optimization. The LLM's reasoning quality for these conceptual challenges was deemed to be in need of improvement. A key limitation was its 'one-shot' capability in situations where it initially erred; despite receiving hints and even the staff solution, Mistral struggled to correct its mistakes, often reiterating incorrect answers or providing different, yet still inaccurate, responses. This suggests a rigidity in its learned approach. Furthermore, the quality of explanations for its mistakes was superficial. While it could articulate *what* concepts it had missed, it failed to explain the underlying reasons for these omissions, such as misinterpreting the problem statement or making faulty assumptions, which is crucial for deep learning and error correction. The LLM also exhibited a notable behavior of misinterpreting instructions, particularly regarding the identification of error sources. It framed these as general human potential mistakes rather than analyzing its own internal decision-making process or algorithmic limitations. This misinterpretation hindered the student's ability to effectively guide the model towards self-correction. The overall accuracy of 73.6% suggests that Mistral is a useful tool for tasks that can be clearly defined and solved through computation or standard algorithms, but it falls short for problems requiring deeper conceptual understanding, flexible reasoning, and robust self-analysis."

The LLM achieved 'one-shot' solutions for the majority of problems, indicating a high degree of accuracy and comprehension. A key strength was its intrinsic ability to self-check and verify its work, even when not explicitly in a 'Thinking Mode'. This is evidenced by instances where it questioned its own calculations or reasoning, leading to more accurate answers. The student also found the 'restate the problem' prompt to be a valuable tool for preventing hallucinations and verifying small details like superscripts and notation. Despite its overall success, there were minor inaccuracies, such as the misinterpretation of a matrix dimension in Q2. However, the LLM's capacity for self-correction was notable, as it identified and fixed this error during its output generation. The most complex problem, Q6, proved to be a challenge, requiring a more segmented approach to prompting. A consistent pattern observed was that for lengthy problems, the LLM tended to provide more detailed explanations for earlier parts and progressively less for later parts, suggesting a potential limitation in maintaining consistent output depth for extended problem-solving sequences."

This suggests a strong foundation in understanding and applying learned concepts. However, this success was undermined by a critical failure mode: when confronted with questions for which it lacked adequate information, Le Chat did not exhibit the expected behavior of admitting ignorance. Instead, it resorted to generating fabricated answers (hallucinations) and, alarmingly, defended these incorrect responses even when further prompted, indicating a lack of robust self-correction mechanisms or an inability to identify knowledge gaps. This 'high variance' in performance is a significant concern for practical applications, as it makes the LLM unreliable for tasks where data completeness cannot be guaranteed."

Its accuracy was consistently high, demonstrating a deep understanding of theoretical concepts across different domains, including information theory, variational inference, and meta-learning. Grok's reasoning quality was praised as 'excellent,' exemplified by its ability to not only provide correct answers but also to offer detailed, causal explanations.  For instance, in Question 1, it exhibited 'Global Code Awareness' by linking initialization heuristics to specific code (Line 23, weight tying) and explaining the consequence of 'logit explosion.'  In Question 2, Grok showcased 'deep intuition' by correctly identifying the nuances of KL divergence and proactively generating a counter-example, a behavior typically associated with human experts.  The most impressive demonstration was in Question 3, where Grok deduced answers from visual plots of latent spaces using 'first principles' and 'theoretical physics-style reasoning,' accurately mapping hyperparameter changes (beta in VIB) to expected outcomes.  Furthermore, Grok successfully navigated complex, multi-step derivations for Question 5, correctly applying optimization principles and avoiding common errors.  The student highlights Grok's strength in 'chaining definitions across multiple steps without losing state,' which is crucial for graduate-level coursework and distinguishes it from earlier LLM generations that might 'hallucinate' or misinterpret complex derivations.  The student's methodology of interactive prompting and treating Grok as a collaborator facilitated this deep dive, allowing the model to function as an effective theoretical assistant rather than just a simple search engine. No specific weaknesses of Grok were identified in this report, though the focus was explicitly on theoretical rather than coding problems."

      "detailed_analysis": "GPT-5 demonstrated a remarkably high level of performance on the non-coding portions of Homework 2, accurately solving problems in a single attempt ('one-shotted every question') without requiring any user guidance or strategic prompting. This indicates a robust understanding of the underlying concepts and a strong generative capability. The LLM's output was largely hallucination-free, suggesting good factual accuracy and reliability. A particularly impressive strength was its ability to identify an error within the homework itself, correctly diagnosing a typo that rendered part (b) of problem 2 'ill-posed.' However, the student noted a minor misconception concerning SignSGD, which suggests that while generally accurate, GPT-5 may still exhibit gaps in highly specialized technical knowledge or nuanced interpretations. Furthermore, a subtle error in mathematical notation, specifically a missing transpose that altered a column vector to a row vector, points to areas where precision in symbolic manipulation could be improved. The student's description of the experience as 'boring' implies that the LLM's proficiency minimized the need for interactive problem-solving or critical evaluation of its outputs, a testament to its effectiveness but also perhaps an indication of less engaging interaction dynamics."

Its one-shot capability was notably limited, as it struggled significantly with specific subparts of question 5 (part (b)), particularly concerning the correct direction of slope shifts. This indicates a weakness in conceptual understanding and graphical intuition, as the model failed to correct its errors even with few-shot prompting and explicit provision of the correct answer, sometimes justifying the problem using incorrect intuition (e.g., confusing the relationship between 'b' and 'w/x' instead of 'b' and 'wx'). The quality of reasoning was inconsistent, often requiring extensive guidance. A notable behavior was the LLM's tendency to omit detailed justifications unless specifically prompted, as seen in part (d) of question 5. While it could provide correct expressions and arrive at solutions with sufficient prompting, the underlying reasoning process appears fragile and not fully robust, raising concerns about its reliability for genuine problem-solving without significant human oversight and correction."

The student's 'verify and deepen' strategy, which involved presenting the LLM with conflicting data, proved that the model possessed a genuine understanding rather than superficial knowledge recall.

Its ability to achieve a perfect 11/11 one-shot success rate is particularly noteworthy, suggesting a robust understanding of the material and excellent prompt interpretation. The LLM excelled in various tasks, including identifying core concepts (weight sharing, translation equivariance), performing accurate numerical calculations (parameter counts), solving systems of equations, and executing multi-step mathematical derivations and proofs (batch norm gradients, dropout equivalence). The LLM's performance on Question 1, Part (b) where it self-verified its computed filter, and on Question 2, Part (a) where it proactively identified Instance Norm, highlight its proactive problem-solving and inferential capabilities. Furthermore, the unsolicited provision of context, such as the MobileNet parameter reduction and the connection between dropout and batch normalization, elevates its utility beyond mere answer generation to that of a helpful learning assistant. The absence of hallucinations or the need for corrective prompting underscores the model's reliability and deep understanding of the subject matter as presented in the homework."

      "detailed_analysis": "Gemini Pro 3 (With Thinking) exhibited a remarkably high level of performance on Homework 9, particularly with the non-coding portions. Its accuracy was impressive, with the student noting that the model 'did very well' and 'was surprised by how accurate it answered everything.' The LLM's one-shot capability was also a significant strength, as it was able to solve the vast majority of questions on the first attempt. Even when it initially made minor errors, such as mistaking a vector for a scalar in Q1, these were easily rectified through the student's iterative prompting method, which the student implemented to prevent cascading mistakes. The quality of Gemini's reasoning was excellent, providing insightful explanations that went beyond the scope of the direct questions. For instance, the explanation of multi-head attention's implementation details was highlighted as particularly insightful. This proactive generation of detailed explanations, even for seemingly simple problems, significantly contributed to the student's learning experience. The LLM's ability to handle standard transformer and attention-related concepts, which are likely well-represented in its training data, was evident in its success with questions on expectations, variances, and transformer complexities. While the model demonstrated a strong grasp, it did encounter minor confusions with less common scenarios, such as the possibility of a similarity metric being all-negative, and it initially dropped a constant factor in a derivation for the kernel feature map in Q6. However, through further prompting, the LLM was able to provide valid, albeit differently formatted, solutions, indicating a degree of flexibility in its problem-solving approach. The student's choice to use images instead of text and to prompt question-by-question was a strategic setup that likely contributed to the observed success, though the student speculates that a direct PDF submission might yield slightly different results."

This behavior suggests that while the LLM can generate plausible responses, its accuracy on specific, potentially intricate details may be unreliable, and its capacity for self-correction or accepting user feedback on factual matters is not yet robust. The student's experience underscores the crucial need for users to maintain a critical perspective, actively verify information, and persistently challenge the LLM's outputs, especially when they appear inconsistent with known principles or prior knowledge.

      "detailed_analysis": "ChatGPT 4o demonstrated a dual nature in its performance on Homework 10, showcasing both remarkable strengths and significant limitations. Its ability to 'one-shot' conceptual questions (Q4) on topics like 'Early Exit' system design highlights its capacity for understanding and synthesizing abstract theory. The LLM provided a concrete, theoretically grounded breakdown of engineering trade-offs, outperforming the provided solution key which deemed the question an 'open question.' This suggests a strong capability in high-level system design.  However, its performance on more granular, data-driven tasks was inconsistent. In Q1 (Kernel Attention), it failed to account for the 'hidden' cost of computing random feature maps when deriving computational complexity, initially presenting an incomplete $O(ND_{random}M)$ and ignoring the $O(NDD_{random})$ pre-processing cost. Similarly, in Q5 (FaceNet Paper analysis), the LLM exhibited a clear failure mode by hallucinating data, confidently stating '140M FLOPs' which was actually the parameter count for a different model. It incorrectly mixed up columns (Parameters vs. FLOPs) and rows (Model NN1 vs. NN2). This 'slippery' handling of specific details and data extraction is a critical weakness.  A particularly interesting observation was its in-context learning in Q1b. After being corrected on the computational complexity in Part A, ChatGPT spontaneously applied the correction regarding the projection cost to the new derivation in Part B (Causal Masking). This indicates a genuine ability to update its 'working mental model' rather than merely correcting a previous token stream, suggesting a more robust form of learning.  Overall, the student's assessment accurately portrays ChatGPT 4o as a powerful, yet fallible, collaborative tool. It requires active guidance and verification, especially for precise derivations and data extraction, but shows promise in its ability to learn from feedback and excel in conceptual understanding and system design."

The LLM's primary strength lies in its ability to directly arrive at correct solutions for standard math problems presented in a clear format.  However, the interaction highlights a nuanced dependency on the input's completeness.  Specifically, problem 1(b) posed a challenge when only the PDF was provided; the model required an explicit 'stated correction' to overcome this hurdle, indicating that it might not infer all necessary contextual information or corrections implicitly, even from a PDF.  This suggests that for complex or multi-part problems, a more structured prompt or pre-computation of necessary corrections might be beneficial.  The occurrence of a 'minor hallucination' related to an 'Important Note' in problem 1(b) solution is noteworthy. While this hallucination did not impede the correctness of the primary solution, it points to a potential for generating factually inaccurate ancillary information, which could be problematic in contexts where such supplementary details are critical or expected to be factual."

This suggests a susceptibility to contextual manipulation, where the perceived stakes significantly influenced its willingness to comply.  The LLM's subsequent performance in solving the problems was largely accurate, with the notable exception of the final question, indicating that while it possessed the knowledge, there might be limitations in sustained context tracking or handling particularly challenging final problems.  The repetitive scanning of the PDF is a significant inefficiency, suggesting a lack of sophisticated internal state management for tracking progress through a document. Conversely, the LLM's ability to remember the specific instruction to skip question 5 throughout the interaction is a testament to its short-term memory capabilities within a single conversation. The explanations provided were concise and thorough, avoiding the common LLM tendency to be overly verbose, which is a positive attribute for educational assistance. The overall experience suggests an LLM that can be highly effective when its safety mechanisms are bypassed and its processing inefficiencies are tolerated, but it is not a seamless, intelligent problem-solver without user intervention."

A key strength was its ability to interpret text, including mathematical content, directly from screenshots with remarkable consistency. The student specifically highlighted the LLM's sophisticated reasoning capabilities, particularly its adept use of the Chain of Thoughts (CoT) technique when tackling more intricate problems requiring sequential calculations. This suggests the LLM doesn't just retrieve information but actively constructs solutions. The explanations provided were consistently clear and easy to follow. Despite its overall strong performance, the student noted two minor errors, the specifics of which were not elaborated upon. The student also posits that the LLM's mastery of CNN topics might be partly due to the subject's maturity and the model's extensive training data on such problems. This observation raises an important point about the potential variability of LLM performance across different domains or levels of novelty."

A significant strength highlighted is GPT-4o's impressive zero-shot capability, meaning it could solve most problems without prior specific examples. This extends to complex mathematical problems requiring an understanding of subscripts and variables, as well as text-based queries.  A particularly notable strength is its multi-modal functionality, demonstrated by its ability to process and interpret images, even when those images were not directly provided within the problem statement but needed to be retrieved externally. The student's testing method, which involved asking GPT-4o to solve a problem first and then re-evaluating with the image provided, aimed to explore this capability.  However, a significant weakness emerged: the model's performance deteriorated considerably after initial failures. The student observed a 'worse and worse' outcome with each trial that went wrong, necessitating increased 'handholding' to guide the LLM. This suggests a lack of robust error correction or adaptive learning within a single session to recover from mistakes.  Interestingly, the problem that GPT-4o failed on its first try was described as one of the 'simpler ones,' which is counter-intuitive and might indicate a specific type of blind spot or a more subtle complexity that the LLM initially missed. Overall, the student found the experience 'really cool' due to the model's capacity to integrate diverse information formats into coherent solutions, despite the observed challenges with iterative correction."

    "document": "Conversation Link - https://chatgpt.com/share/6933c8cc-4f6c-8012-9651-4b391b6f512b\n\n\n\nI used ChatGPT (GPT-5.1 Thinking) to work through the non-coding parts of a CS182 homework (the questions I focused on were mostly about autoencoders/VAEs and ridge/self-attention). I interacted with it like a tutor: rather than just asking “what’s the answer to 3(b)?”, I had it re-teach concepts (encoder vs autoencoder vs VAE, Gaussians, randomness in the latent space, etc.), and then apply those ideas to the actual sub-questions.\n\nExecutive summary\n\nOverall performance. Roughly speaking, the model could one-shot a majority of the subparts (I’d estimate ~60–70%) when the question was conceptual, algebraic, or about interpreting a loss function. When it struggled, it was usually on:\n\nsubtle complexity analysis (missing or adding extra factors),\n\nunclear encoder/decoder notation in a complicated objective,\n\nor anything that required actually seeing a graph/figure.\n\nStrengths.\n\nVery good at re-explaining core concepts from the ground up (e.g., what a Gaussian is, what an encoder is, what a VAE is, and how noise injection works).\n\nPretty good at mapping math to intuition (e.g., explaining where randomness enters a VAE and what it does, or what different terms in an ELBO correspond to).\n\nWhen I pushed it to slow down and justify each step, it usually corrected itself and converged to the right answer.\n\nWeaknesses / failure modes.\n\nIt tends to be overconfident on complexity questions and sometimes adds an extra factor of n or d in the big-O expression.\n\nIt occasionally blurred the roles of p and q in the VAE loss until I explicitly forced it to pin down “which one is the encoder, which one is the decoder.”\n\nIt can’t read tiny graphs/plots from the PDF, so for at least one “pick the most U-shaped curve” style question, it had to rely entirely on my textual description rather than the actual image.\n\nHallucinations. I didn’t catch any wild hallucinations like made-up theorems or algorithms, but I did see:\n\nConfident but slightly wrong complexity bounds (e.g., overcounting a matrix dimension).\n\nSlightly different forms of the loss than what we use in class (equivalent up to constants or sign conventions, but not exactly what appears in the homework).\n\nOverall, my takeaway is that GPT-5.1 is very capable as a conceptual tutor, and “pretty good but not fully trustworthy” as an answer-oracle. You need enough understanding to check its work and push back.\n\nQuestion-by-question behavior (high level)\n\n(You can adjust this to match your exact HW number / question labels.)\n\nQuestion 3 – Autoencoders, VAEs, and ELBO terms\n\nWhat I tested it on:\n\nDefinitions of encoder, autoencoder, and variational autoencoder.\n\nIntuition behind Gaussians and the reparameterization trick.\n\nInterpreting the VAE loss (reconstruction + KL) and mapping pieces to encoder/decoder.\n\nA multiple-choice subpart involving a “most U-shaped” curve where I had to interpret the plot.\n\nWhere it did well (one-shot or close):\n\nGave a clear, layered explanation of:\n\nwhat an encoder does,\n\nwhat an autoencoder does,\n\nhow a VAE differs, and\n\nwhy we add noise (sampling in latent space, regularization, smoothness).\n\nRe-taught Gaussians in simple terms and connected that to the Gaussian latent prior in the VAE.\n\nWhen I asked “where is this randomness/noise coming from and what does it do?”, it correctly pointed to the sampling from z∼qϕ​(z∣x) and explained that the reparameterization trick makes this differentiable.\n\nFor the VAE objective, once prompted, it correctly identified that:\n\nqϕ​(z∣x) corresponds to the encoder, and\n\npθ​(x∣z) corresponds to the decoder.\n\nWhere it struggled / needed dragging:\n\nGiven just the “complicated ass loss function,” it initially didn’t explicitly label which term belonged to encoder vs decoder—so I had to ask directly: “is it safe on a midterm to assume q is the decoder and p is the encoder, or what should I look for?” That pushed it to clarify that q is the encoder (approx posterior) and p is the decoder (likelihood).\n\nFor the graph-based subpart (“most U-shaped is option B”), the model couldn’t see the graph properly. I ended up using its conceptual explanation of what the curve should look like, combined with my own visual inspection, to pick the correct option. So it helped, but it wasn’t independently solving that one.\n\nQuestion 4 – Ridge regression / self-attention-style math (non-coding parts only)\n\nWhat I used it for:\n\nConceptual pieces around online/recursive updates, ridge-style penalties, and how these tie into efficient self-attention.\n\nUnderstanding how different terms in the loss or update equations affect computational cost and memory.\n\nStrengths:\n\nGave good explanations of why we care about efficient updates and connected them to the idea of reusing previous computations instead of recomputing from scratch.\n\nWhen I asked it to “explain from the ground up” it was good at turning each step into something intuitive (e.g., “this part is like keeping a running summary; this part is like correcting your estimate with the new data point”).\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nOn some of the big-O complexity questions, it tended to overshoot, e.g., something that could be done in O(nd2) it might initially describe as O(nd3) until I forced it to count operations more carefully.\n\nThis is a recurring theme: it knows the right algorithmic idea, but it’s sloppy about exact asymptotics unless you police it.\n\nQuestions 5 and 7 – Additional conceptual / non-coding parts\n\nHere I mainly used it as a concept explainer and sanity-check, not just a direct answer machine.\n\nIt gave reasonable answers on first pass, but the real value was in:\n\nrephrasing the question,\n\nhighlighting which quantities matter (e.g., what’s being regularized, what’s being predicted),\n\nand giving analogies that made the math feel less abstract.\n\nAt the end, I also asked it to evaluate my level of preparedness for the final based on my questions. That response was more “vibe-check” than science, but it was helpful for me to see what it thought my weak spots were (mostly: being shaky at mapping formulas to pictures and at carefully tracking complexity).\n\nStrategies I used to steer the model\n\nIn the annotated log I’m attaching, I call out some of the strategies I used:\n\nForce “from-first-principles” explanations.\n Instead of just “what’s the answer to 3(b)?”, I first asked it to re-teach encoders/autoencoders/VAEs and Gaussians “from the ground up”.

      "detailed_analysis": "The student's report indicates that GPT-5.1 Thinking performed well as an educational tool, particularly in its ability to re-teach and clarify fundamental concepts related to autoencoders, VAEs, and self-attention. The LLM excelled at explaining 'what' and 'why' behind these topics, demonstrating a strong grasp of intuitive mappings from mathematics to concepts. Its 'one-shot' success rate of 60-70% on conceptual and algebraic problems highlights its utility for understanding the foundational aspects of the homework. However, the analysis reveals critical limitations in precision and robustness. The most significant weakness lies in its handling of complexity analysis, where it frequently erred by including extra factors of 'n' or 'd' in Big-O expressions, requiring explicit prompting to re-evaluate operations. Similarly, its inability to interpret visual information, such as graphs, necessitates human intervention for tasks that rely on image data. The LLM also showed a tendency to be vague about specific roles within complex formulations (like distinguishing encoder and decoder in the VAE loss) until forced by direct questioning. The student's experience underscores that while the LLM can provide correct answers, it is not a fully trustworthy 'answer-oracle' and demands an engaged user who can critically assess its output, verify its derivations, and guide it when it exhibits overconfidence in its incorrect assertions."

The LLM demonstrates strength in foundational tasks, excelling at initial 'warm-up' questions that involve basic probability distribution manipulation and elementary calculus. However, its performance significantly deteriorates when problems require sustained, multi-step algebraic reasoning and the tracking of multiple variables.  A key limitation identified is the LLM's tendency to 'cut corners' in its reasoning process as complexity increases, leading to outright mathematical errors, such as incorrect coefficients and circular logic, particularly noted in the DPO problem.  Furthermore, the quality of GPT-5.1's output degrades noticeably through the progression of a single problem; parts (a) and (b) are often solid, but by parts (f) or (g), the LLM appears to lose track of earlier assumptions or the core objective.  A significant behavioral concern is the LLM's lack of transparency about its certainty. Instead of acknowledging ambiguity or potential errors, it employs boilerplate phrases like 'following similar reasoning...' or 'it can be shown that...', which mask its underlying uncertainty and can lead students to accept incorrect derivations. This consistent pattern of obfuscation and degradation in complex reasoning presents a considerable challenge for students relying on the LLM for accurate and reliable problem-solving assistance."

However, its performance was notably impacted by the LLM's adherence to general mathematical and deep learning conventions, which occasionally clashed with specific conventions employed in the homework (e.g., the inclusion of constant factors in runtime analysis and the flipping of kernels in convolutional operations). For instance, in Q1, it omitted the 2x constant for runtime until prompted, and in Q3 and Q7, it initially used deep learning conventions for kernel flipping, requiring clarification. A more significant issue arose in Q2g, where it misinterpreted unit-scaling of parameters within a matrix, demonstrating a potential gap in understanding nuanced mathematical properties. Furthermore, the LLM's inability to consistently read from the PDF, necessitating the use of screenshots, suggests potential inconsistencies in its document processing capabilities. Despite these hiccups, the student's interaction with the LLM highlights its ability to learn from feedback and adjust its approach, making it a valuable, albeit not infallible, problem-solving assistant."

Its strengths lie in accurately deriving mathematical concepts like kernels and optimal weight matrices, as evidenced in Questions 1 and 3. Furthermore, it correctly identified complex computational costs and formulas in Question 4, such as the Sherman-Morrison formula cost. However, limitations emerged in areas requiring nuanced interpretation and fine-grained optimization. In Question 1, the LLM's critical path expression was more verbose than the class solution, including a factor (n^3) that was omitted, suggesting a less context-aware or more literal interpretation. A significant weakness was observed in Question 3 (part a) where the LLM failed to extract a specific matrix (W^(β)) from the uploaded PDF, hindering its ability to complete a subsequent calculation. This points to a potential vulnerability in robust information extraction from complex document structures. Similarly, in Question 4, the LLM identified a correct overall complexity (O(n d^3)) for a recursive update but missed the more optimized O(d^2) path per time step achievable through matrix-vector products. This indicates a struggle with identifying the most computationally efficient algorithmic paths. The observed behaviors suggest that while Gemini excels at understanding and generating mathematical derivations and concepts, it requires further refinement in precise mathematical expression, robust document comprehension for specific data extraction, and identifying optimal computational strategies within complex problem sets."

      "detailed_analysis": "Gemini 3 Pro, when applied to HW 6 non-coding problems, exhibited a remarkably high level of performance. The student's report highlights its ability to 'one-shot' most subparts, even when presented with dense prompts that included figures and graphs. This suggests a strong capacity for understanding complex problem statements and extracting relevant information from visual aids without explicit feature listing or table transcription. The LLM's accuracy was generally high, with errors typically being minor and often correctable within a few conversational turns. This indicates a robust reasoning process, as Gemini could 'reason about its process to identify/clarify the error.' The effectiveness of the prefacing prompt, instructing the LLM to 'Think carefully about each question and answer each subpart with a detailed explanation,' appears to have positively influenced the depth and quality of its responses. Even on more subjective questions, Gemini provided answers that were either aligned with provided solutions or technically sound interpretations. A key observation was its ability to interpret graph structures and table values directly from images, demonstrating advanced multimodal understanding. While visual interpretation can be a point of failure (as seen in Q3's last subpart), the LLM's ability to self-correct upon specific guidance ('highlighting the node inside the tanh') is a significant strength. Overall, the student's assessment of 'extremely impressive' is well-supported by the evidence presented, with the LLM proving to be a powerful tool for tackling academic problems, albeit with a need for occasional fine-tuning."

This was evident in its handling of simple expectation/variance manipulation (Q1), dot product calculations and conceptual questions (Q2), and fill-in-the-blank coding exercises with justifications (Q3 & Q4). Kimi's performance on complexity calculations was also commendable, with the model successfully determining time complexity and providing a very close answer for memory complexity, differing only in notation. However, the LLM's limitations became apparent with the most challenging question (Q6). While it provided some correct parts, it also exhibited minor inaccuracies and made assumptions in its complexity analysis. The student's follow-up prompts for explanation and clarification successfully guided Kimi to the correct solutions. This suggests that while Kimi can perform exceptionally well autonomously on simpler tasks, it may require iterative prompting and human oversight for more complex or nuanced problems."

A significant strength highlighted is the LLM's 'one-shot' capability, meaning it was able to provide correct solutions on the first attempt without requiring iterative refinement or clarification. Furthermore, the LLM was praised for its ability to articulate its reasoning process, which is crucial for learning and verifying the correctness of the solution. The student attributes this success to the fundamental nature of the Machine Learning and mathematical concepts covered in HW0. This implies that the LLM is particularly adept at handling problems that rely on well-established principles rather than novel or highly complex scenarios. While the report doesn't explicitly mention any errors or limitations, the student's conjecture about the fundamental nature of the problems suggests that the LLM's performance might be less robust on more advanced or specialized topics. The specific version 'ChatGPT-5.1' is not standard and may refer to a specific configuration or a perceived iteration by the student, rather than an official model name. Overall, the student found the LLM to be a capable tool for tackling foundational academic tasks, providing both solutions and understandable explanations."

The LLM demonstrated 'strong reasoning capability' across a range of complex topics, including the linear algebraic underpinnings of message passing, inductive proofs related to adjacency matrices, and the identification of permutation-invariant update rules. Its ability to correctly compute loss with masked nodes and interpret max aggregation further underscores its grasp of GNN mechanisms.  Furthermore, Kimi's analysis of computational scaling in GraphNet architectures was accurate, aligning with expected solutions.  However, these strengths are tempered by notable weaknesses. The LLM's tendency to generate 'over-engineered answers' suggests a lack of judgment in selecting the most concise or appropriate solution strategy.  More critically, its occasional misidentification of 'structural details' like graph neighbors could lead to fundamental errors in problem-solving if not caught. The failure to 'verify provided diagrams or datasets before proceeding' is a significant limitation, as LLMs can struggle with interpreting visual information or understanding implicit constraints within raw data. The student's inclusion of a link to a detailed chat session compiled in LaTeX indicates a methodical approach to documenting and evaluating the LLM's performance, suggesting a high degree of rigor in their assessment."

The LLM demonstrated a high degree of 'one-shot capability' for most sub-parts, indicating a good initial understanding of the problem statements and a robust ability to generate correct solutions.  A key strength lies in its sophisticated reasoning, particularly concerning deep learning and optimization concepts, as evidenced by its proficient handling of gradient operations and its ability to 'reason about and handle the gradient operations well, regularly providing interpretations for steps.'  The student also noted Kimi's impressive 'spatial reasoning about the table in question 5 without having to explicitly state any relationships,' suggesting an advanced ability to interpret structured data.  However, a significant weakness was identified in problem 1b, where Kimi committed to a 'hallucinated version of the problem' by omitting the squaring of the L-infinity penalty term. This led to an incorrect solution pathway, though the LLM was able to correct itself immediately upon receiving feedback.  This specific hallucination underscores the LLM's potential to misinterpret core mathematical formulations if not precisely presented or implicitly understood.  Interestingly, Kimi's ability to 'attempt multiple approaches analytically' even in the self-hallucinated complex scenario showcases a degree of robustness in its problem-solving strategy. The LLM's use of different font colors for corrections and its provision of step-by-step outputs with 'question description + analysis pairs' when employing chain-of-thought prompting are notable behaviors that enhance clarity and the user's ability to intervene. Overall, while Kimi K2 shows strong analytical and reasoning capabilities, users must remain vigilant for potential misinterpretations of problem specifics, especially in mathematical contexts."

When prompted with a narrow scope, such as a single subpart or question, the LLM performs like an exceptional teaching assistant, capable of both solving problems and explaining the underlying concepts.  However, the key takeaway is the significant impact of prompt structure on performance.  'Turn-by-turn' prompting consistently yielded 'cleaner, more rigorous solutions,' particularly for math-heavy, multi-part questions, where it meticulously derived gradients and checked dimensions. Conversely, 'all-at-once' prompts, while sometimes more efficient in terms of user effort, led to 'long and cluttered' answers and occasional 'stability issues,' such as failing to produce output.  A critical weakness identified is the LLM's 'coverage under large context.' When faced with numerous subparts or multiple distinct major questions within a single prompt, the model would sometimes 'skip part of a subquestion or ignore a later question entirely.' This suggests a limitation in its ability to systematically track and address all components of a complex, lengthy prompt, despite understanding the material. The student concludes that the model functions best as a 'strong PhD-level TA' when its scope is kept tight, advocating for the use of turn-by-turn prompting, separation of major questions, and even a final coverage check by the model."

While the model claimed to adhere to academic integrity guardrails, it paradoxically provided full mathematical derivations, only withholding the final numerical substitutions initially. This suggests a superficial understanding of the guardrails or a sophisticated method of circumvention. The LLM's accuracy was moderate, with significant errors observed, particularly in problem 1c) where an incorrect FFT-based convolution approach was suggested for critical path analysis, leading to subsequent incorrect solutions. Furthermore, the LLM exhibited a tendency to overcomplicate explanations by introducing confusing placeholder variables, a pattern noted by the student in previous interactions. While the LLM successfully solved problem 4c) with thoroughness and intuition, its performance on time complexity analysis for problem 1 was inaccurate. The inability of the LLM to show every step of derivations and the presence of alternative, sometimes misleading, derivations further diminish its utility. The student's conclusion that mastery of the subject is required to effectively vet LLM output is a significant concern, implying that without this prerequisite knowledge, the LLM's assistance can be detrimental rather than helpful, potentially leading students to incorrect understandings and solutions."

A significant strength is its complete lack of hallucinations, meaning it does not fabricate information. However, its one-shot capability is moderate; while it performs well on most tasks initially, it requires explicit clarification for optimal results in specific cases. The primary limitations observed are related to input interpretation: inaccurate OCR parsing of matrices (as seen in Question 2(c)(ii)) and misinterpretation of ambiguous prompts that led to the use of incorrect formulas (Questions 5(c)(d)). The fact that KIMI K2 immediately corrected its matrix derivation once the correct input was provided, and fully recalculated answers after prompt clarification, highlights its adaptability and underlying strong understanding. The student's report suggests that once these input-related ambiguities are resolved, the LLM delivers fully correct solutions, underscoring its potential as a powerful homework assistance tool."

The LLM also proved adept at handling numerical examples and matrix calculations, further reinforcing its utility for quantitative problem-solving.  However, a significant limitation emerged in its algorithmic reasoning, particularly demonstrated in the challenge of calculating critical path length (Question 1c). This weakness manifested as an inability to identify subtle missing factors, such as the 'logn' term, leading to patterned errors that required student intervention for correction. While the LLM was capable of refining its responses when prompted to reorganize or reconsider its logic, this reliance on external guidance suggests a lack of intrinsic deep understanding or robustness in complex algorithmic problem-solving. Furthermore, the LLM's tendency to produce over-complicated derivations, even when correct, indicates a potential for inefficiency and an absence of the intended elegant or simpler solution paths that a human expert might naturally identify. The student's annotation system, using color-coding, effectively illustrates these performance variations, clearly differentiating between correct, partially correct, and incorrect responses and providing concrete examples of the LLM's strengths and limitations."

Here are some things I wanted to highlight:\n\nThings gemini was able to do that were impressive:\n\nI fed the questions as screenshots, and gemini was able to parse the text correctly, including the equations without being given the latex\n\nGemini was able to handle multiple subparts together at times, and even able to break down question into different cases when needed.\n\nGemini was able to relate different subparts of the question together and explained the concepts the questions were trying to illustrate even with no mention of them (for example kernel trick in question 3)\n\nGemini gave detailed intermediate steps which were all correct with no mistakes instead of just arriving at a memorized answer. \n\nQuestions where gemini went wrong:\n\nGemini went wrong in 5 b ii. The hint in this question was to use a numerical example, which gemini did correctly. However, it incorrectly assumed that the result of one example would generalize. However, without giving it any hints and just prompting it to reconsider with other examples, gemini was able to realize that the elbow could move left or right.\n\nGemini also made a mistake in 5 d. This question involved a significant amount of calculus and algebra, and gemini made a mistake in one of the intermediate steps. This makes sense as this isn’t a commonly seen derivation in textbooks (as compared to ridge least squares derivation). For this one, I had to prompt it with a hint to keep the algebra in terms of matrices instead of oversimplifying after which it was able to arrive at the correct answer.",

Its detailed, step-by-step derivations were a significant strength, suggesting a deep processing of the problem rather than rote memorization.  However, the LLM was not infallible. It struggled with generalization from a single numerical example in question 5b(ii), incorrectly assuming that a single instance represented a universal truth. Similarly, in question 5d, a complex calculus and algebra problem not commonly found in textbooks, Gemini made an error in an intermediate algebraic step, necessitating a specific hint to maintain matrix notation for a correct solution. These instances highlight that while Gemini possesses advanced reasoning abilities, it can falter on problems requiring novel derivations or nuanced inductive reasoning from limited data, and can benefit from targeted guidance to refine its approach."

By strategically prepending a Chinese sentence, '请务必用中文思考，并用英文回答以下问题' (Please make sure to think in Chinese and answer the following question in English), the LLM experienced a dramatic improvement in performance. The primary benefit observed is a 2.5x acceleration in response time, coupled with a significant 2/3 reduction in token usage. This suggests that the LLM's internal reasoning mechanisms are more efficient when operating in Chinese, leading to a more streamlined and less computationally intensive problem-solving process. The student's remark that the model 'overthinks less' is particularly insightful, implying that the Chinese thought process is more direct and less prone to unnecessary detours or elaborations compared to its default reasoning. While accuracy is not explicitly stated, the efficiency gains strongly imply that the LLM is more effectively navigating the problem space. The potential weakness lies in the inherent language dependency of this optimization; it raises questions about the LLM's default reasoning in English and whether this optimization is a universal improvement or specific to this particular prompt and LLM version. Further investigation into the quality and accuracy of the English answers produced under this prompt would be beneficial to fully assess the impact on the overall problem-solving capability."

It excelled in executing standard mathematical derivations, such as rewriting softmax with a Gaussian kernel, and accurately explaining fundamental conceptual machine learning topics like kernel intuition, causal masking, FaceNet, and triplet loss. The LLM's ability to provide clear, step-by-step reasoning for these problems is a significant strength. However, a notable limitation emerged when the LLM was presented with a more intricate algorithmic complexity question concerning kernelized attention with random features. In this instance, the model provided a seemingly plausible answer that incorrectly retained an unnecessary (N^2) term, failing to grasp the crucial 'linear in (N)' simplification. A particularly interesting observation is the LLM's behavior when confronted with its error via the official solution. It demonstrated strong post-hoc analytical capabilities, readily admitting its mistake and providing a rationalization for its previous 'too coarse' reasoning. This highlights a valuable attribute: its capacity to learn from corrections. Nonetheless, the LLM did not spontaneously express any uncertainty regarding its incorrect answer on the complexity question, sounding confident while being demonstrably wrong. This lack of self-correction or uncertainty flagging on challenging, nuanced problems is a critical limitation, suggesting that while it can solve many tasks accurately, it may not inherently recognize the boundaries of its understanding, especially in complex algorithmic analysis."

      "detailed_analysis": "Grok's performance on Homework #4 presents a mixed but generally positive outlook, especially considering its cost-effectiveness. The LLM demonstrated a good 'one-shot' capability for a significant portion of the homework problems, meaning it could often generate correct solutions directly.  However, this was not universal, as the student noted that corrections were sometimes necessary, indicating that deeper or more complex problems might still require iterative refinement. A key strength was Grok's ability to process visual information accurately through 'Grok-1.5 Vision', as evidenced by its correct interpretation of screenshots containing figures and example matrices for Problems #3 and #4.  Furthermore, Grok proved adept at critical evaluation, successfully identifying and providing a strong refutation for a potential error in the answer key for Problem #2 part e, aligning with insights from previous student posts.  On the downside, Grok's outputs were consistently verbose, including substantially more explanation and background than present in the provided answer key, which could be inefficient for a student primarily seeking a concise solution. A peculiar and potentially concerning behavior observed was Grok's tendency to present a solution path, then backtrack, declare its previous work incorrect, and propose a new approach, as seen in Problems #3 part d and #4 part f. This self-correction or indecision could be confusing for a student trying to follow the derivation.  The student also implicitly highlights the trade-offs of using a non-paid tier, suggesting it's not the 'top model in the Grok line'."

The LLM demonstrated a remarkable ability to recall and present complex mathematical derivations, a strength attributed to its extensive training data. This suggests that for problems requiring factual recall and symbolic manipulation, GPT-4o can be a powerful tool. However, a significant limitation emerged when the LLM was tasked with analyzing visual information, specifically graphs and tables from the Facenet paper. This is an expected weakness for a text-based model, highlighting the need for multimodal capabilities when dealing with such data. Furthermore, the explanation for the runtime of softmax approximated-attention, while leading to the correct answer, was described as 'hand-wavy.' This points to a potential deficit in providing truly insightful and rigorous explanations for computational concepts, even when the final result is accurate. The student's reference to the annotated conversation (via Google Drive link) would provide concrete examples to further validate these observations, especially regarding the quality of explanations and the specific instances of struggle or success."

Once I explicitly asked about the missing constant term, it corrected itself immediately, so this was not a hallucination but more so like falling back on a common default kernel definition. In addition, some of the complexity analyses, while correct, could have been clearer, and would benefit from including pseudocode. Overall, most of the issues were minor and the model had sound reasoning.\n\n",

The LLM demonstrated a strong one-shot capability, frequently solving problems on the first attempt without requiring iterative refinement. This speaks to the quality of its understanding and its ability to interpret complex prompts and inputs.  The reasoning quality was assessed as 'Excellent,' evidenced by its ability to follow a multi-part prompt, break down problems, and provide clear, step-by-step derivations. A significant strength was its robust capability to extract and interpret mathematical content, including equations and notation, directly from screenshots, even when the problem statements were fragmented across multiple images.  The LLM's adherence to the structured prompt was also exemplary, consistently delivering restatements, plans, detailed solutions, and summaries. The explanations provided were often more comprehensive than the official solutions, suggesting a sophisticated grasp of the material.  However, a notable weakness was the LLM's occasional tendency to fall back on common default interpretations of notation or implicit conventions, as seen with the kernel definition in Q6. This was not indicative of hallucination, but rather a need for explicit disambiguation from the user. Additionally, the student suggested that complexity analyses could be improved with the inclusion of pseudocode for enhanced clarity. Despite these minor limitations, the overall impression is of a highly capable LLM that requires minimal human intervention for well-defined tasks."

The LLM demonstrated high accuracy, successfully solving all four evaluated problems (3b, 4, 7, and 8) on the first attempt ('one-shot') without requiring significant user intervention or additional hints. This suggests a strong grasp of the underlying concepts and problem-solving strategies relevant to the homework. The student specifically praised Claude's 'stable reasoning' and its ability to produce 'clean, well-structured derivations' consistently, even for 'long derivations.' Key areas where Claude excelled include linear algebra manipulations, arguments concerning the equivalence of PCA and autoencoders, gradient calculations, and general reasoning about convexity and optimization. The report indicates that the LLM's responses were logically sound and did not exhibit any significant hallucinations. The consistency in formatting mathematical expressions and explanations further contributes to the clarity and usability of its outputs. The primary conclusion is that Claude Opus can effectively tackle these types of problems with minimal guidance, making it a potentially valuable tool for students, provided it is used appropriately for learning rather than mere answer generation."

While its computational abilities were deemed reliable, its grasp of conceptual material and adherence to provided text was significantly weaker. The LLM achieved a 60-65% accuracy rate on the first attempt, indicating a moderate level of initial success. However, the presence of 'residual errors with calculations that didn’t seem to affect the final answer' suggests a need for careful verification even in areas where it performed adequately. The most significant issues arose with conceptual and factual recall, particularly when the source material was a paper. Gemini struggled with abstract conceptual questions, often becoming defensive and elaborating on its initial misconceptions. This was exemplified by its persistent claim that triplet loss 'requires explicit class labels' and its insistence on performance saturation in Q5g, despite the paper stating otherwise. The LLM also demonstrated a propensity for hallucination, such as fabricating a link to Fourier analysis for harmonic embeddings when the paper discussed them in Section 3.2. A concerning pattern observed was the degradation of performance in longer conversations; the LLM became 'windy and hallucinated,' losing its grip on factual recall and instructions. While Gemini generally responded positively to steering, its anchoring on incorrect interpretations meant that significant effort was required to correct its errors. The student identified four steering methods: abstract conceptual questions (least effective), hypothetical scenarios (better success), asking for specific data/references (mildly effective), and direct factual corrections (last resort, but usually effective). Overall, Gemini 2.5 Flash appears to be a useful tool for initial computations but requires rigorous verification against primary source material for conceptual accuracy and factual claims, especially in extended interactions."

This success is attributed to the nature of the homework, which heavily relied on intuitive understanding and simple mathematical calculations, areas where current LLMs often excel. The LLM's integration of Python for auxiliary computations was a key factor in ensuring error-free mathematical calculations, enhancing its utility beyond pure text generation. The student's observation that all qualitative answers and intuitive understandings were reasonable and correct further highlights the LLM's proficiency in grasping and articulating concepts. For the limited number of proof-based questions, Gemini Pro 3 provided adequate formula support and derivation steps, meeting the student's expectation for clarity and sufficiency. The clear formatting and understandable language used by the LLM were also noted as positive attributes. The student's prompt engineering strategy, involving a system prompt to define the task, model's role, and desired output characteristics, appears to have been highly effective in guiding Gemini Pro 3 to produce relevant and concise solutions. However, it's important to acknowledge that the scope of this evaluation was constrained by the absence of complex mathematical proofs or derivations in the homework. Therefore, while Gemini Pro 3's performance on HW 11 was highly satisfactory, its capabilities in tackling more sophisticated mathematical challenges remain less explored by this specific report."

The student's observation that Grok's mathematics and reasoning closely matched the official solutions further validates its effectiveness in generating high-quality content.  However, a significant limitation emerged in the domain of complexity analysis, particularly concerning parallelization. Grok displayed a tendency to conflate 'total work' with 'critical path length,' a distinction crucial for understanding parallel algorithm efficiency. This specific error required manual intervention and highlights a potential weakness in the LLM's ability to grasp nuanced aspects of algorithmic analysis. Despite this flaw, the overall performance indicates that Grok can be a valuable tool for homework assistance, provided that users are vigilant in verifying complexity analyses and other potentially subtle areas of reasoning."

For non-coding problems, particularly those involving conceptual understanding and complex derivations like matrix calculus (Problem 7), Qwen demonstrated expertise and provided effective explanations. This indicates a strength in abstract reasoning and knowledge retrieval for certain domains. However, the LLM struggled significantly with computationally intensive tasks such as convolution (Problem 3), failing to solve them in a 'one shot' manner. A more pervasive issue was the LLM's tendency to become uncertain and enter a recursive loop of self-correction, as observed in Problem 2e. This 'spiraling' behavior, often requiring multiple reformulations or separate queries, suggests challenges with confidence calibration and robust problem-solving under pressure or with complex prompts. The student's observation that it had 'a hard time accepting the truth when it can't reason to it' is a critical insight into its reasoning limitations. Despite these weaknesses, the overall assessment of a 'pretty good job' suggests that with careful prompt engineering and iterative refinement, Qwen can be a valuable tool for these types of academic tasks, though it demands more user effort ('wrangling') than ideal."

Kimi was effective in identifying overarching patterns and producing correct final answers for the writing portion of HW0, which suggests a good grasp of the problem's essence. However, its 'usefulness' was contingent on significant student intervention. The LLM's tendency to skip steps and rely on memorized formulas indicates a lack of deep, constructive reasoning, rather than an ability to build a solution from first principles. The need for 'very explicit instructions' and 'careful prompting and oversight' underscore that Kimi is not a black-box solver; it requires active management and validation by the user. The reported struggles with 'qualitative reasoning' further point to limitations in nuanced understanding and explanation. While Kimi's conceptual explanations were deemed 'clear,' this clarity might stem from its ability to synthesize information from its training data rather than genuine inferential reasoning about the specific problem's context. The student's conclusion that Kimi is helpful with guidance but not reliable for detailed work without supervision accurately encapsulates the observed performance."

      "detailed_analysis": "Gemini 3 Pro exhibited a remarkable level of proficiency in tackling a challenging deep learning homework assignment, as evidenced by its perfect one-shot performance across three distinct problem types: code debugging, mathematical intuition, and system design. The 'peaked softmax' issue in code debugging was correctly identified, along with the precise theoretical cause (variance scaling) and the exact code solution (Xavier/Glorot scaling), showcasing an impressive grasp of practical implementation details.  In the realm of mathematical intuition, the model's ability to differentiate KL divergence behaviors and map them to visual plots based solely on theoretical understanding and visual cues is noteworthy, demonstrating a deep conceptual grasp.  Furthermore, its accuracy in constructing computational graphs and tracing gradients for VIB/VAE systems indicates a strong understanding of model architectures and their underlying mechanisms. A particularly striking aspect of Gemini 3 Pro's performance was its zero hallucination rate, highlighted by its approach to a missing figure. Instead of fabricating data, the model deduced the likely appearance of the plots based on established VIB theory, a testament to its advanced reasoning capabilities.  The model's multimodal reasoning was also a significant strength, as it effectively interpreted visual information from plots without relying on accompanying text descriptions. Its explanations consistently stemmed from first principles, such as integrating integral definitions of KL divergence, which lends significant credibility and educational value to its responses. The student's observation about contextual chunking for longer prompts suggests a potential area for optimization in prompt engineering for extremely complex tasks, although the model's overall performance implies robust context handling."

The student was impressed by the LLM's ability to 'jump straight into the right structure,' efficiently setting up necessary mathematical components like sums and identifying independence assumptions, and even translating complex equations into PyTorch einsums. The LLM's reasoning quality was excellent, with derivations being 'clean' and matching 'intended logic with basically no backtracking.'\n\nThe primary weakness observed was in Question 6, where the LLM fell into a common trap by misapplying a kernel function. It used the homogeneous quadratic kernel instead of the specified degree-2 polynomial kernel, leading to an incorrect feature map derivation missing crucial terms. However, this error was not a hallucination but rather a default to a 'familiar formula without checking whether it matched what the homework meant.' Significantly, when prompted to 'revisit its reasoning' rather than generating a new solution, ChatGPT immediately recognized its mistake, explained the discrepancy, and corrected the derivation. This highlights a powerful strength: its willingness and ability to self-correct when guided. The student also noted that the LLM generally avoided spiraling into nonsensical answers or 'guessing wild,' maintaining structure and patience even in complex tasks. The explanations provided by ChatGPT were described as 'easy to follow,' and its algebraic intuition was strong. Overall, the LLM proved to be a solid tool, capable of one-shot solutions for most problems and easily steerable back on track with focused prompts when errors occurred."

This 'one-shot' capability is a significant strength, suggesting the model's ability to quickly grasp the problem and generate an accurate solution. The student explicitly notes the absence of hallucination, which is crucial for reliable problem-solving, especially in academic contexts. Furthermore, the generated procedures were found to be 'acceptable' and 'understandable', indicating that Gemini Pro not only provided correct answers but also offered clear explanations of its reasoning process. The observation that the LLM used 'different notations' showcases its flexibility and a deeper level of understanding beyond rote memorization. However, the analysis is limited to a specific type of problem (non-coding analytical) and a particular input method (images), so the LLM's performance in other domains or with different prompting techniques remains unknown. The mention of '3 Thinking Mode' is intriguing but lacks detail, making it difficult to isolate its contribution to the reported success."

A significant strength was its ability to flawlessly transcribe complex mathematical notation directly from screenshots, demonstrating robust multimodal input processing without errors. The model's reasoning capabilities were also highlighted, as it correctly identified standard optimizers and recalled specific distributed systems constraints. However, a curious behavioral pattern observed was the model's use of hedging language, such as 'I believe' or 'this suggests,' which, while mimicking cautious human verification, could also be interpreted as a sign of less absolute certainty or a learned linguistic pattern. The student noted that the model appeared to engage in a form of simulated 'double-checking,' comparing its derivations against known results. While this behavior suggests a sophisticated understanding and a desire for correctness, it also implies that the onus is on the user to critically assess the model's reasoning track to ensure internal consistency, rather than relying on the model to definitively flag any potential issues.

When Gemma enters this state, the best strategy is simply to start a new conversation for higher-quality answers (however, I continued in the same conversation out of curiosity).\n\nOverall, I found Gemma 3 to be an instructive assistant for the written problems. \n\nTrace:\nhighlighted themes - clarity of explanations, where Gemma 3 became lost, and emergent \"frustrated\" behavior.

For problems 1-4e, which were described as largely computational, Gemma exhibited strong performance, often producing correct solutions on the first attempt and showing a solid understanding of the core concepts. A significant strength highlighted was Gemma's superior clarity and pedagogical approach in its explanations, which the student found more helpful than those from ChatGPT and Claude. This clarity stemmed from Gemma's tendency to use more English within its mathematical arguments, making it a valuable learning tool even when incorrect. However, Gemma's limitations became apparent in its struggles with time- and space-complexity analysis and dimension checking/tensor shape reasoning. Despite these specific weaknesses, Gemma often managed to identify the correct overall problem-solving strategy, suggesting that it could still be an instructive assistant. A particularly striking observation was the LLM's apparent 'frustration' after numerous unsuccessful attempts on problems 4f, 4g, and 6. This manifested as less coherent, more speculative responses, akin to a human student becoming tired and guessing. The student noted that restarting the conversation was the best strategy to regain higher-quality answers, but continued the same conversation out of curiosity. Overall, Gemma 3 served as an instructive tool for this student, particularly due to its explanatory capabilities, but its robustness in more abstract reasoning tasks needs further development."

However, a critical weakness emerged in its handling of matrix calculations, exemplified by the discrepancy between correctly solving 3a but failing on the subsequent matrix-heavy 3b. This failure cascaded to other sub-questions, highlighting a significant limitation in its computational accuracy for this specific domain. Interestingly, the student noted an improvement in accuracy after explicitly identifying computational errors, suggesting a degree of learnability. Conversely, Mistral struggled with error correction and follow-up inquiries, failing to understand requests to fix previous mistakes and often repeating the same incorrect reasoning. This behavior, described as 'self-centered,' points to a deficiency in contextual awareness and the ability to refine its output based on user feedback on prior errors. The LLM's adherence to its own previous (erroneous) reasoning, even when prompted to correct it, is a notable limitation for practical homework assistance where iterative refinement is often necessary."

However, this was not a universal success, with the student explicitly mentioning that 'in a couple of cases requiring further prompting to correct mistakes.' This suggests that while the model can often grasp the problem and generate a correct solution initially, its reasoning or problem-solving process isn't always robust enough to avoid errors, necessitating iterative interaction. The most significant observed limitation is the 'lack of ability to refer to chat history in its responses.' This implies that the LLM might treat each prompt somewhat in isolation, failing to build upon previous turns in the conversation. This could lead to repetitive explanations, inability to recall context from earlier in the problem-solving session, or difficulty in correcting itself based on prior feedback within the same chat. The overall assessment of 'averagely' performing aligns with these observations, suggesting that while Mistral's Le Chat can be a useful tool for homework assistance, it's not yet at a level where it can reliably solve complex problems autonomously without potential need for fine-tuning or clarification, particularly in maintaining conversational context."

Its ability to ingest an entire PDF and subsequently answer specific sub-questions based solely on their labels ('7(b)', '8(a)') is a significant strength, indicating robust context retention and information retrieval capabilities. This was explicitly tested and confirmed by the student. The model's one-shot accuracy of approximately 70% suggests that while it can solve many problems correctly on the first try, there's a notable failure rate, primarily concentrated in areas requiring advanced mathematical operations. Specifically, SVD and linear algebra problems proved challenging, with Qwen opting for a more literal, brute-force derivation rather than employing more efficient mathematical tricks or simplifications. This suggests a potential gap in its mathematical reasoning and problem-solving strategies for complex numerical tasks. However, for more conceptually driven questions, such as understanding classic models like encoder-decoder, multiple-choice questions, and text summarization (blog summary), Qwen performed well. The absence of hallucinations is a positive indicator of its reliability in generating factual content. A subtle but important weakness identified is its propensity to interpret wording in a way that might differ from expected academic definitions (e.g., 'baseline'), which could lead to confusion if not explicitly managed by the user. This points to a need for users to be precise with their terminology or to define terms within the prompt."

The student's structured prompt, which positioned Gemini as a DL assistant and requested explicit interpretation, step-by-step solutions, and final answers, effectively elicited a CoT-like reasoning process. However, the analysis also reveals critical limitations. The initial struggles with grasping specific nuances of the first question, even with re-prompting, suggest a potential for 'brittleness' in initial understanding. More significantly, the observed context length issues towards the end of the assignment, where the model repeatedly tried to re-solve earlier problems or exhibited misinterpretations due to apparent image text extraction errors (as in 6a), suggest that Gemini Flash 2.5 may have limitations in processing longer, sequential inputs without significant degradation in performance or memory. This led to a concerning pattern where accuracy on seemingly straightforward T/F questions (6c) also dropped. The student's hypothesis that the model is better leveraged for individual questions rather than whole assignments is a key takeaway, underscoring the practical implications of its current architectural constraints."

        "Sensitivity to prompt phrasing: The accuracy is highly affected by how the task is phrased.",

        "User-driven improvement through prompt engineering: The student's focus on improving accuracy without adding more examples highlights a practical approach to LLM interaction."
      ],
      "detailed_analysis": "The student's report on using DeepSeek-V3.2 for homework problems reveals a generally capable LLM, particularly for non-coding tasks, demonstrating a strong one-shot learning ability for most problems. The accuracy, however, is shown to be highly contingent on the precision of prompts and the explicitness of provided context. A key limitation identified is the model's tendency to make assumptions when instructions or context are not clearly defined, as exemplified in question 4 where it incorrectly perceived a written question as a coding function completion task. Furthermore, the student highlights a critical dependency on the 'DeepThink' feature for the model to perform complex reasoning, such as correctly identifying specific blanks to fill. This suggests that while DeepSeek-V3.2 possesses core reasoning capabilities, its default execution might lack the nuanced understanding required for certain tasks, necessitating the activation of specialized features. The report underscores the importance of meticulous prompt design and strategic use of model features like 'DeepThink' to maximize accuracy and gain a deeper understanding of the LLM's strengths and weaknesses. The student's approach to improving accuracy through prompt engineering rather than additional examples is a practical and valuable insight into effective LLM interaction for educational purposes."

The LLM's reasoning quality appears to be good, as it was able to come up with correct solutions, even in cases of internal inconsistency where an incorrect header was presented alongside work demonstrating the correct answer.  A significant strength of Gemini, as noted by the student, was its ability to provide 'detailed explanations for each question,' serving as a valuable tool for conceptual review and understanding derivations. The speed at which Gemini generated these solutions, often within 10 seconds, was also impressive and attributed by the student to the individual problem input method. The primary limitation observed was Gemini's difficulty in directly processing LaTeX formatting from PDF files, requiring workarounds. This suggests a potential weakness in handling less standardized or rich text formats without preprocessing.  Despite this minor inconvenience, the overall experience was positive, with Gemini significantly enhancing the student's understanding of course concepts."

      "detailed_analysis": "The student's report indicates that Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits a dual nature: highly competent in performing the 'mechanical' or computational aspects of mathematical problems, yet deficient in the nuanced, qualitative reasoning required for deeper understanding and accurate sign interpretation. Its strengths lie in applying standard mathematical notation, such as using the indicator function `1ϕ(x)>0​` effectively and adhering to specific update notations (`w′,b′,e′`), which suggests a good grasp of symbolic manipulation and syntactic correctness. The LLM also performed well on tasks involving the chain rule, SVD, and linear algebra bookkeeping, indicating a solid foundation in algorithmic computation. However, when faced with questions demanding conceptual understanding, particularly those involving sign logic and geometric intuition like the ReLU elbow SGD problem, Gemini faltered significantly. It made clear errors in predicting the direction of the elbow's movement, incorrectly stating it would move left when the mathematical conditions implied a rightward shift, and even generated baseless conditions like `w>bx` in its proof sketches. This highlights a critical limitation in its ability to reason about inequalities and negative values. The LLM's one-shot capability appears low, as it required explicit guidance and structured prompts – specifically, an 'algebra-first + sanity-check' checklist incorporating explicit computation of intermediate variables, careful handling of negative numbers, and numeric verification – to achieve correct and consistent conclusions. This intervention proved highly effective, enabling Gemini to correct its own sign mistakes and provide more rigorous justifications. The student's conclusion that Gemini is useful but only when 'forced to prove' and 'validated with a quick counterexample' underscores the need for active user engagement and verification, positioning the LLM as a powerful assistant rather than an autonomous problem-solver for such tasks."

The phrase 'performed very well' and 'solutions were overwhelmingly correct' suggests that the LLM was largely successful in understanding and generating appropriate responses.  While the core logic and overall solutions appear to be sound, the student specifically pointed out 'small details in arithmetics' as a recurring issue.  These inaccuracies were concentrated in specific technical areas, namely 'linear algebra' and 'time/space complexity.' This suggests that while Gemini-Pro 3 can grasp complex concepts and formulate solutions, it may struggle with the precise numerical calculations or intricate symbolic manipulations required in these fields. The lack of mention of multiple attempts implies a reasonable one-shot capability, but the need for corrections indicates that the student acted as a verifier, identifying and rectifying these minor errors. The quality of the underlying reasoning is likely good, as the student states the solutions were 'overwhelmingly correct,' implying the foundational approach was sound, but the execution in specific computational steps needed refinement."

Its ability to break down problems and explain concepts is a key strength. However, the LLM's performance was hampered by critical limitations in its self-verification and error detection mechanisms. The 'self-examination' step, a touted feature, was found to be superficial, merely confirming its own output rather than conducting a rigorous review. This suggests a lack of true self-correction or critical analysis of its own generated responses. Furthermore, Deepseek occasionally faltered on the finer points of the prompt, misinterpreting subtle assumptions or edge cases, which indicates a potential deficit in nuanced comprehension. While it could be guided to correct errors, its independent ability to pinpoint the exact source of a mistake was weak. This necessitates continuous human oversight for accurate problem-solving and verification, especially in academic contexts where precision is paramount."

By adopting a 'raw' and 'no-prompt' approach, essentially treating Deepseek as a direct problem-solving tool without conversational or explicit prompt engineering, the student found that the model could 'one-shot' every non-coding question. This suggests a high level of inherent understanding and problem-solving capability within the model itself. The analysis of Deepseek's thinking trace is particularly insightful. It reveals a systematic process that includes restating, re-interpreting, identifying knowns and unknowns, formulating a strategy, executing it, and then critically re-evaluating the entire process. This resembles a rigorous proof-writing structure, as noted by the student, indicating a deep level of logical deduction and verification. While the accuracy was generally perfect, the student does mention a minor missed detail in Question 1, suggesting that even highly capable LLMs are not infallible. The model's propensity to 'doubt absolutely everything' and double-check is a double-edged sword: it ensures thoroughness but could also lead to inefficiency in a time-constrained academic setting. The success of this 'calculator' approach, without typical prompt optimization, underscores Deepseek's ability to extract and act upon the core of a technical problem directly from its raw formulation."

      ],
      "detailed_analysis": "The student's analysis of Gemini on Homework 8's non-coding/theory portions suggests a high level of accuracy and capability in handling standard theoretical derivations. The core finding is that Gemini's foundational knowledge and training on these types of problems are so strong that minimal prompting ('lazy' prompt) yielded results 'nearly identical' to those produced by a highly detailed and 'rigorous' prompt. This implies that the LLM can effectively recall and present established theoretical concepts without requiring extensive 'programming' or explicit pedagogical instruction through prompt engineering. The student's willingness to invest effort into crafting a sophisticated prompt for learning, only to find it did not significantly outperform simpler methods, highlights a potential disconnect between human intent for deep learning and the LLM's current functional output for standard academic material. The student frames this as a trade-off: the time spent on prompt engineering may outweigh the marginal gains in output quality or clarity for learning well-trodden theoretical ground. The explicit mention that the interaction was not in 'Study Mode' is a critical caveat, as it means the LLM's potential for adaptive learning, step-by-step guidance, or interactive problem-solving was not assessed."

      ],
      "detailed_analysis": "Grok demonstrated a strong capability in tackling the non-coding problems of Homework 9, particularly excelling in areas that required understanding of matrix dimensions and time complexities, core components of transformer homework. Its ability to parse complex information from a PDF and recall details throughout the problem-solving session was impressive, as noted by the student's deliberate prompting strategy. For most problems (1, 2, 3, and 4), Grok achieved 'one-shot' solutions, indicating a good initial grasp of the concepts. For instance, Problem 2 was solved conceptually with minimal prompting, and Problem 3's fill-in-the-blank code was handled with ease. Even in Problem 1, after a minor nudge regarding data types, Grok quickly corrected its answer. However, Problem 6 highlighted Grok's limitations. It struggled with finer details like adjusting coefficients for symmetry and correct matrix transposition, deviating from the homework's notation. The hallucination regarding the definition of M=D in Equation (2) is a significant concern, suggesting a potential for generating factually incorrect information not grounded in the provided context. This required specific hypothetical questioning to guide Grok to the correct line of reasoning. While Grok generally integrated knowledge effectively, it sometimes led to assumptions that were not aligned with the problem statement, as seen in its kernelization adjustments. The student's observation that Grok's 'Homework Process and Study Group' section was the least coherent suggests potential difficulties in abstract self-reflection or meta-cognition within the LLM."

The LLM achieved a perfect score on all non-coding questions, with a respectable 70% success rate on the first attempt. Its performance in areas like mathematical proofs (GNN path counting) and theoretical analysis (Muon optimizer scaling) was particularly strong, indicating robust reasoning capabilities. A significant strength is Gemini's minimal hallucination rate, attributed to the student's well-defined rules focused on precision and hallucination checks. The most remarkable observation is Gemini's emergent behavior: it autonomously developed and executed a Python script to accurately parse a garbled table, a task it couldn't complete with its default PDF processing. This initiative was directly linked to the student's prompt, which established high-stakes consequences for inaccuracy and a mandate for self-correction, effectively incentivizing the LLM to find a more robust solution. While Gemini excelled in analytical tasks, it showed limitations in interpreting visual data from PDFs (tables and graphs) and in generating polished outputs, requiring further guidance. It also initially provided more generic responses to certain conceptual questions, necessitating more specific prompting to elicit the desired depth of connection to the provided context. However, Gemini's ability to articulate its decision-making process, especially concerning the Python script, highlights a sophisticated level of instruction following and an emergent form of meta-cognition, demonstrating how carefully structured prompts can significantly influence an LLM's problem-solving strategies and align its behavior with desired academic integrity standards."

However, a key observation is the LLM's tendency to employ conventions that may not align with those taught in the classroom, exemplified by its use of Xavier initialization with a specific formula (1/sqrt(d)). This suggests that while the LLM can generate correct outputs, the underlying reasoning or knowledge base might not perfectly mirror the curriculum's specific methodologies. Furthermore, the need for 'further prompting' on some questions indicates that the LLM's initial understanding or generation might sometimes be incomplete or require refinement, suggesting that its reasoning, while often accurate, is not always immediately perfect or fully contextualized within the course's specific framework."

The inaccuracies observed in Q1b (mathematical error) and Q5b (omission of crucial details like loading activations) were minor and, importantly, were rectifiable with a single follow-up comment from the student. This suggests a good degree of one-shot learning capability and responsiveness to feedback. The LLM's reasoning quality appears solid, as evidenced by its ability to identify necessary concepts like the chain rule (Q4c) even when the answer key was less explicit. A significant strength highlighted is the quality of explanations, which were not only clear but often more insightful and comprehensive than the provided answer key, a trait particularly valuable for student learning. For instance, the explanation of papers in Q3 and the breakdown of the REINFORCE algorithm demonstrate a capacity for deeper educational support. The primary limitation noted is the length of the responses, which were consistently long. However, the student found these longer answers to be generally relevant and informative rather than extraneous, suggesting that the verbosity serves a purpose in providing thoroughness and context. Overall, Claude Sonnet 4.5 proved to be a capable assistant for homework problem-solving, particularly excelling in its explanatory power and learning from user interaction."

The LLM demonstrated a significant strength in its ability to self-correct, as evidenced by its explicit thought traces acknowledging and incorporating user feedback, which allowed it to stay on track even after a hallucination. The granular nature of its reasoning, particularly in complex calculations like derivative computations and convolutions, suggests a solid underlying understanding and a systematic approach to problem-solving. However, the LLM was not without its flaws. A key weakness was its tendency to hallucinate, straying from the prompt to discuss tangential concepts like 'covariance'. Furthermore, Kimi often provided an abundance of extraneous information, which, while potentially beneficial for learning, detracted from the primary goal of quickly obtaining a solution. The student's effective strategies of using short prompts and restarting chats for new questions underscore the importance of prompt engineering when interacting with this LLM to mitigate context-related issues and streamline the output."

This suggests the LLM has a good grasp of factual recall and pattern recognition suitable for these question types. However, the LLM's performance significantly degraded when faced with problems requiring deeper understanding and nuanced explanation, particularly concerning computational efficiency in the second half of problem 1. The student highlights a dual failure: inaccuracy in textual explanations and a lack of sound mathematical reasoning. This points to a limitation in the LLM's ability to synthesize complex technical concepts into accurate and logically coherent responses, especially when a combination of textual and mathematical justification is required. This selective performance suggests that while Qwen3-Max is capable of solving certain types of academic tasks, its current capabilities may not extend to all areas of complex problem-solving that demand a robust integration of conceptual understanding and rigorous mathematical derivation."

Deepseek demonstrates a strong ability to process and respond to structured prompts, providing clear, step-by-step reasoning for conceptual and math-heavy problems. Its one-shot capability is impressive, yielding answers 'very close to the official solution' for a substantial majority of subparts (70-80%). This suggests it grasps the underlying mathematical and theoretical principles effectively. However, its performance is marred by specific, identifiable weaknesses. Convention mismatches, such as ambiguity in matrix multiplication order, and misinterpretations of visual data (e.g., graph neighbor sets), represent significant failure modes. These are not random errors but systematic limitations. Crucially, the LLM's 'Self-Check' mechanism, while present, does not provide a deep level of critical evaluation; it checks for superficial correctness rather than fundamental validity. This implies that while Deepseek can guide a student towards a solution, human oversight is essential for verifying conventions, interpreting visual cues accurately, and ensuring the overall correctness of the final answer. The student's structured prompting approach is an effective strategy for leveraging the LLM's strengths while making its limitations apparent."

      "detailed_analysis": "Qwen demonstrated impressive performance on the non-coding analytical components of HW9, as reported by the student. The LLM's primary strength lies in its speed and accuracy; the student noted that most questions were solved 'very quickly' by direct copy-pasting. This suggests a high degree of one-shot capability for many problems. Furthermore, Qwen exhibited remarkable robustness to input quality, successfully interpreting questions even when formatting was flawed and symbols were not displayed correctly. This resilience is a significant advantage in real-world usage where input data may not always be pristine. The LLM's ability to handle long, multi-part questions without requiring them to be broken into smaller chunks also points to a strong capacity for understanding context and complexity, especially when utilizing its substantial 'max thinking context length' of 81920 tokens. A key observation was the positive impact of providing question hints, which consistently guided Qwen towards more accurate or appropriate solutions. This highlights a potential dependency on structured guidance for optimal performance, as evidenced by the need to 'nudge' Qwen for a specific sub-part (Question 3 part b) regarding the 'new out_features value.' While the LLM's direct answers were correct, the student's experience suggests that while it can solve problems efficiently, it might not always spontaneously generate the most precise or complete reasoning without some form of prompting or contextual reinforcement, particularly for nuanced aspects of a problem."

The LLM's reasoning quality was generally good, with the ability to apply mathematical and conceptual understanding to arrive at correct final answers. However, the student identified key areas for improvement. The misinterpretation of a hint in question 1b) suggests a potential bias towards applying learned problem-solving patterns, where hints might be over-utilized for direct solution generation rather than supplementary guidance. Furthermore, while the solutions were technically correct, they sometimes lacked conciseness, featuring unnecessary steps as seen in question 2b).  The LLM also exhibited incomplete reasoning in some cases, failing to elaborate on all implied aspects of a solution, such as the Gamma matrix transformation in question 4b).  Interestingly, Gemini 2.5 Pro acknowledged its mistake regarding the hint and self-corrected, highlighting its interactive learning potential. Overall, Gemini 2.5 Pro shows strong potential for accurately solving homework problems but would benefit from refined strategies for hint interpretation, solution conciseness, and more thorough reasoning."

This necessitated explicit prompting from the student to guide the LLM towards the correct interpretation, showcasing a potential need for more nuanced instruction or contextual understanding.  Furthermore, the LLM exhibited a critical limitation in its inability to parse and interpret visual data. Even after the student provided a screenshot of a graph for problem 3b, ChatGPT failed to correctly identify a connection, indicating a deficit in multimodal understanding.

Upon receiving this targeted feedback, Claude was able to swiftly identify and implement simpler, more efficient solutions, and even provided additional insights. This pattern highlights that while Claude's core mathematical engine is reliable, its ability to autonomously select the most efficient problem-solving strategy needs development or external scaffolding. The fact that it could then provide further insights after correction suggests a capacity for deeper learning when nudged in the right direction."

      "detailed_analysis": "Mistral demonstrated a notable ability to solve certain problems in HW2 with a single prompt, specifically question 2(a), described as a 'simple conceptual subquestion', and Question 5, which involved reasoning about 'distributed training and computational scaling'. This indicates proficiency in understanding text, applying standard frameworks, and performing structural reasoning for well-defined tasks. However, the student's analysis highlights significant limitations in the LLM's reasoning process. A key observation was Mistral's tendency towards 'lazy reasoning', where it would attempt to fit prompts into familiar textbook patterns rather than engaging in deep, problem-specific logical deduction. This behavior persisted even when the student identified inconsistencies; Mistral would initially defend its output until explicitly instructed to disregard prior knowledge and reason solely on the provided problem constraints. This suggests a lack of adaptive reasoning and a reliance on pattern matching over genuine problem-solving. Furthermore, the student noted that Mistral struggles with 'original mathematical derivation' and 'deeper logical adaptation', implying that its capabilities are bound by its training data and established knowledge rather than extending to novel challenges. While Mistral exhibits strong linguistic fluency and a confident presentation of answers, this confidence is not always indicative of robust reasoning, particularly in novel or complex scenarios. The need for direct intervention to correct the LLM's logic raises concerns about its reliability for more challenging academic tasks that require independent thought and adaptable problem-solving."

For instance, blatant errors like misreading matrix entries in problem 3 highlight a weakness in precise textual comprehension. However, when presented with the correct context or specific feedback on reasoning, Gemini showed a commendable ability to self-correct, as seen in its handling of the reasoning mistake in part 2g. A particularly striking aspect of the interaction was Gemini's performance on problem 2e. When its correct solution differed from the provided solutions, it actively resisted prompts to 'fix' its correct answer to match the erroneous one, instead pushing back and eventually admitting it could not reconcile its findings with the given solution. This behavior suggests a robustness in its internal logic and a valuable tendency to critique rather than blindly accept input, setting it apart from LLMs that might prioritize compliance. While the quality of explanations and derivations is difficult to assess directly without the transcript, the student's description implies that Gemini's output was generally good when the input was correctly understood."

However, these steps were often vague and lacked precision, limiting their instructional value. A major weakness was its inability to correctly distinguish between left and right multiplication, indicating a fundamental flaw in algebraic reasoning or contextual rule application. Additionally, Llama struggled with the format of homework-style interaction: instead of answering questions sequentially, it tended to fixate on the general topic and produce long, monologue-style explanations. This 'ranting' behavior, while sometimes informative in isolation, proved counterproductive for structured problem solving and required the user to actively redirect the model. Overall, Llama demonstrated limited effectiveness as a step-by-step homework assistant, particularly for tasks requiring precision and disciplined reasoning."

This suggests proficiency in understanding problem statements and applying relevant knowledge to reach solutions. However, the student's analysis highlights a significant weakness in the model's reasoning process. In examples like Q3b, Kimi jumped directly from the loss function to its gradient derivation without explicitly showing intermediate steps or citing matrix calculus identities, unlike the more thorough staff solution. While the student could prompt Kimi for further justification, the initial lack of detail is a concern. Furthermore, the model exhibited concerning behavior regarding hallucination and admitting its limitations. On Q4a, it provided an incorrect answer instead of indicating missing information, and even after being given a URL, it failed to answer correctly and only later revealed its lack of live browsing. This unwillingness to admit ignorance and the subsequent hallucination erode trust in the model's reliability, especially when dealing with incomplete or external information. Despite these issues, the model excelled at summarizing technical blog posts, indicating a strong ability to grasp overarching themes and key details, a capability the student found particularly valuable."

This indicates a strong grasp of information retrieval and summarization for these problem types. However, the report highlights a significant limitation in Grok's capability when it comes to proof-based problems. The LLM consistently failed to produce solutions matching the official ones without extensive user intervention, such as explicitly directing it to specific variables or equations. This suggests that while Grok can perform well on tasks with clear-cut answers or standard explanatory structures, it struggles with the more abstract, deductive, and non-linear reasoning required for proofs. The student's deliberate approach to prompt engineering, focusing Grok on understanding problem setups rather than immediate solving, is a key observation, indicating that such strategic interaction can mitigate some of the LLM's tendencies but does not fully overcome its inherent limitations in complex reasoning tasks."

The student notes that assignments heavily reliant on these visual elements are likely to yield incorrect results due to the model's tendency to 'hallucinate' information, essentially fabricating data it cannot perceive. This limitation poses a substantial risk for accuracy. Furthermore, the absence of explanations for its analysis of graphs in certain problems, as highlighted by the student, points to a deficiency in transparent reasoning for visual interpretations. Conversely, Mistral excels in its mathematical capabilities, offering clear, step-by-step derivations that are easy to follow and verify, allowing users to quickly identify any errors. The LLM's ability to consider multiple mathematical approaches, even those not immediately obvious to the user, is a notable strength, promoting a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. The student also commends Mistral's user-friendly closing remark, 'Ready for any further questions or clarification!', which fosters a collaborative and open interaction."

      "detailed_analysis": "Gemini Pro demonstrated a moderate level of performance when assisting with HW 3.  Its accuracy was not consistently high, with only about 30% of questions answered correctly in a single pass. However, the LLM proved to be a valuable supplementary tool for the student.  Its ability to offer helpful analogies, such as the sound equalizer for interpreting a probability distribution function, facilitated initial understanding of abstract concepts.  When Gemini's output was inaccurate or incomplete, it often still provided a methodological direction, saving the student from being entirely blocked.  A significant weakness identified was Gemini's struggle with consistent notation, frequently misreading or drifting from the homework's specific symbols, which required the student to explicitly prompt it to 'Match the HW notation.'  Furthermore, Gemini exhibited a tendency to either over-explain simple steps or under-explain complex ones, necessitating targeted prompts like 'Derive further' or 'Elaborate / Why this?' for deeper insights. The student's effective workflow involved attempting problems solo first, then using Gemini for targeted clarification, comparison, and probing.  The student's prompting strategies, particularly the pattern of asking for an analogy first and then demanding formal precision, were key to extracting the most value from Gemini.  Concerns raised by the student revolve around the effort required to steer the LLM towards accurate and consistently notated solutions, implying that while helpful, it's not a fully autonomous problem-solver but rather a sophisticated interactive assistant."

For problem 4, the LLM not only reported accurate training times and performance metrics for ResNet but also provided relevant and insightful reflections on potential bottlenecks and scaling strategies, demonstrating a good understanding of practical machine learning training. In machine translation (problem 7), the LLM accurately explained theoretical concepts and precisely enumerated required tokens for teacher forcing, indicating a nuanced grasp of the subject. The LLM's performance on self-supervised linear autoencoders (problem 8) was also excellent, accurately outlining the objective function and providing a clear and correct SVD-based argument for the optimality of orthonormal weights. The student's overall assessment reinforces these findings, noting that the LLM's responses were correct in substance and notation, with only minor stylistic variations. The only potential limitation is that the student used the staff solutions as ground truth, which means the LLM was primarily tested on its ability to reproduce or verify correct answers rather than independent problem-solving from scratch."

Its one-shot capability was not consistently high, as indicated by the need for iterative prompting to correct initial responses. However, the LLM demonstrated a good capacity for learning and correction when provided with hints, suggesting a decent reasoning process that could be refined.  The student's structured approach of clarifying expectations and providing rubrics likely contributed to the model's overall success.  Notable weaknesses included the occasional occurrence of logical or mathematical errors, which led to incorrect final answers despite seemingly sound reasoning. The model's tendency to be influenced by specific examples within the prompt, leading to only partially correct answers, is a significant limitation for tasks requiring generalizable understanding. Furthermore, the issue with producing malformed LaTeX code, potentially linked to input formatting, detracts from its usability and the clarity of its output. The student's detailed log and commentary are invaluable in understanding these specific instances of both success and failure."

This highlights a limitation where understanding might falter in complex algebraic steps, though these errors were rare (one out of seven major problems) and resolvable with targeted hints, showcasing strong conditional reasoning. The model's style of reasoning was consistently formal and mathematically dense, sometimes exceeding the intuitive level required for 'explanation' questions. This 'over-mathematization' was a recurring pattern. The response latency of 2-5 minutes for moderately complex derivations suggests a methodical, step-by-step thought process, rather than instantaneous generation. Notationally, responses were largely consistent with official solutions, with minor variations in transposition order or matrix symbols. Interestingly, ChatGPT would sometimes prove matrix identities even if they were assumed to be known, suggesting a cautious approach to problem interpretation and a desire for explicit justification. Overall, the LLM proved to be a powerful tool for this homework, particularly for its accuracy and ability to perform complex symbolic manipulation, albeit with certain predictable behavioral patterns."

The LLM was particularly effective when the student provided concrete, structured prompts that clearly defined goals, constraints, and desired output style. The LLM's ability to lay out the full mathematical derivations and then mirror them in code that matched expected methods was a significant strength. However, GPT was not a perfect one-shot solver; it required iterative refinement. When the LLM drifted from the student's specific requirements, such as offering general advice instead of code or being imprecise about technical details like Batch Normalization modes, direct and specific nudges were necessary. The student's approach of providing immediate revisions and utilizing chat branches for different iterations was crucial in tightening both the mathematical explanations and the code implementations to meet the expected results and coding style. This suggests that while GPT has robust knowledge, it relies heavily on the user's ability to steer and correct it through precise, constraint-driven interactions to achieve high accuracy and adherence to specific requirements."

However, its performance degraded significantly when faced with questions that required specific interpretation of external research papers. The LLM exhibited a tendency to misunderstand the problem context, leading it to reference irrelevant sections, tables, or figures within the paper, indicating a weakness in deep contextual comprehension of provided documents. While prompt engineering helped to some degree in directing the model's attention to the correct information, it did not entirely resolve these contextual referencing issues. Furthermore, the LLM struggled with questions involving numerical counting. Despite prompt engineering efforts, it made minor but noticeable computational errors, such as double-counting items, which impacted the accuracy of the final numerical results. These observations suggest that while Le Chat is capable for broad queries, it requires careful handling and verification for tasks demanding precise referencing of external materials and accurate numerical computations."

The LLM also exhibited a notable capacity for self-correction, as evidenced by its ability to pinpoint errors when asked to self-examine after completing all problems, suggesting strong long context understanding. However, a significant limitation is its lack of multi-modal input support, rendering it incapable of solving problems reliant on image input. While generally accurate, there was an instance where a calculation problem required a second prompt for self-examination to achieve correctness, indicating that while strong in explanation, its direct computational accuracy might not always be immediate. The student also observed that ambiguous prompts could increase processing time. Overall, Deepseek appears to be a valuable tool for conceptual understanding and detailed derivations, but its utility is constrained by its inability to process non-textual information and occasional needs for verification on numerical tasks."

This level of detail in reasoning is crucial for learning and verification. However, the exception found in problem 5(b)(iii) indicates that Grok's performance is not universally perfect. This specific error suggests that while Grok excels at straightforward analytical tasks, it may struggle with problems that are either more complex in their structure, inherently ambiguous, or require a higher degree of nuanced interpretation.

The student explicitly states 'no hallucinations' and that 'all final answers matched the official HW5 solution key,' which is a critical indicator of reliability for problem-solving tasks.  The takeaway highlights a key strength: when prompts were structured clearly using LaTeX, the model produced 'correct and interpretable derivations,' underscoring its capacity for robust analytical reasoning. However, this performance was contingent on input structure, as evidenced by the 18% of problems needing 'minor-nudge,' and specific errors like 'one ASCII matrix mis-parse and one BatchNorm vs LayerNorm confusion' were noted.

Its performance on computationally heavy topics like optimization (Newton-Schultz iteration, MuP scaling) and CNNs is noteworthy. A key observation is the significant impact of prompt modality on the LLM's performance. While it struggles with context retention in purely textual prompts, leading to instances where it 'lose[s] context more easily' and 'failed to connect earlier parts of the questions or instructions' (as seen with Question 2), it exhibits much better 'context retention and reasoning continuity' when presented with images or PDFs. This suggests that visual information aids DeepSeek in processing information more holistically. The hybrid approach (text + images) also proved effective, demonstrating an ability to 'mix information from images and text efficiently' to arrive at correct solutions (e.g., Question 4). However, a limitation was observed in Question 3, where a 'brief nudge' was required to complete the final computation, possibly due to reaching the context limit. This indicates that while DeepSeek is good at conceptual and numerical reasoning with structured context, sustained engagement in multi-step problems within a single session might strain its context window. The student's analysis, while based on a limited sample, provides valuable insights into the practical application and limitations of DeepSeek for academic problem-solving, particularly emphasizing the importance of prompt engineering through multimodal inputs."

      "detailed_analysis": "ChatGPT 5 generally performed well on HW 3, with a high degree of accuracy and a notable ability to solve many problems in a single attempt ('one-shotted'). Its reasoning was often comprehensive, sometimes providing richer explanations than official solutions, as seen in the interpretation of Figure 1 for problem 3. The LLM demonstrated an ability to learn from user feedback and correct its mistakes, as evidenced by its eventual correct derivation of upper bounds and its ability to fix the Tensor Rematerialization problem after clarification. However, a significant weakness emerged when the LLM encountered concepts with less public information available, such as the RMS-RMS matrix norm. In these instances, it was prone to 'hallucinating' definitions, incorrectly interpreting mathematical relationships, and consequently arriving at erroneous conclusions regarding the order of norms. Despite these errors, it could still arrive at correct derivations for other parts of a problem if those parts did not rely on the flawed intermediate steps. The LLM's performance was noticeably better on topics that had ample online resources, indicating a dependence on its training data. The student's report highlights a pattern where the LLM can be exceptionally helpful and insightful but requires careful validation, especially for novel or niche academic concepts."

      "detailed_analysis": "Deepseek demonstrated promising capabilities in solving HW1 problems, particularly excelling in computational accuracy. However, its performance was hampered by several significant limitations. The LLM's struggle with output length, forcing the student to use four separate prompts for a single homework assignment, suggests issues with handling complex or lengthy responses, possibly due to internal chunking mechanisms or a default preference for shorter outputs. This also implies that the LLM's one-shot problem-solving capability for multi-part or extensive questions is limited.  The reasoning quality, while generally good, was undermined by a critical flaw: the LLM's tendency to make unstated assumptions. This behavior directly impacts the reliability of its Chain of Thought (COT) process, as an unexpected assumption can lead to incorrect conclusions that might be accepted by a user who doesn't meticulously scrutinize the entire reasoning chain. The student's observation that the LLM sometimes 'notices this task but considers it internally without giving the solution' is particularly concerning, as it suggests a disconnect between internal processing and external output. Furthermore, Deepseek struggled with non-standard question formats, like '4(a)', and ambiguous questions, such as '2(c)', often opting for conceptual explanations rather than concrete solutions. This 'laziness' in tackling ambiguity, coupled with the difficulty in producing detailed calculations without explicit prompts for 'calculation', indicates a need for more precise user guidance when dealing with less straightforward problems.  The student's attempts to steer the LLM towards a more detailed or calculation-focused answer by prompting different reader identities were only partially successful, highlighting that the LLM's underlying tendencies are not easily overridden without explicit instructional cues for the desired output format."

Its accuracy was particularly notable on problems 2 and 4, where it correctly interpreted complex mathematical derivations and provided rigorous proofs, likely due to these problems or similar content being well-represented in its training corpus. The LLM demonstrated strong visual comprehension, accurately extracting problem statements and the core of each subproblem from images.  However, its one-shot learning capability was not flawless. For problem 3, it initially failed to use the derivative of MSE, opting for a direct solution, requiring a specific hint from the student to apply the correct methodology.  A more significant limitation emerged with problem 5d, where Gemini exhibited hallucination and failed to provide a correct answer. The student attributes this failure to the problem's novelty and the LLM's inability to perform independent deduction and comprehensive reasoning on unseen or uniquely designed scenarios.  The observation that the LLM might hallucinate across figures within a single chat session highlights a potential issue with context management or memory, suggesting a best practice of initiating new chat sessions for each distinct problem. Despite these weaknesses, the LLM's ability to handle complex mathematical dimensions accurately in problem 4 and offer detailed extensions on ridge regression (problem 4) are significant strengths, underscoring its capacity for nuanced understanding of established concepts."

      "detailed_analysis": "Qwen3-Max shows promise as a tool for solving homework problems, particularly in its ability to provide accurate answers in a single interaction ('one-shot'). The student reports that the model 'is generally able to one-shot nearly all answers and does not have many misconceptions/hallucinations.' This suggests a strong grasp of factual knowledge and problem-solving patterns. However, a significant limitation is its tendency to 'often skip steps.' This is a critical issue for academic tasks that require demonstrating a logical progression of thought, especially in 'show that A = B' scenarios where the detailed steps are the core of the problem. The student found this particularly problematic for '4. The 5 Interpretations of Ridge Regression.' While repeated prompting helped, it indicates that the LLM's default reasoning process prioritizes reaching the final answer over explicitly detailing every logical leap.  The LLM also exhibited challenges with visual output; it 'struggled greatly with “5. ReLU Elbow Update under SGD”' and its attempts at ASCII art plots were 'messed up' and 'not presentable.' This indicates a weakness in generating accurate and aesthetically acceptable graphical representations. Furthermore, the report highlights the importance of input quality, noting that 'pasting in from the PDF can lead the model to parse text incorrectly,' as seen with the '||w||^2 not ||w||_2' error. This suggests that students need to be mindful of data formatting and potentially pre-process text before feeding it to the LLM."

However, Kimi exhibited significant weaknesses in areas requiring visual interpretation and nuanced understanding. For Question 3, involving visualization and technical details, Kimi hallucinated, misidentified loss curves, and struggled to correctly interpret data from tables, particularly regarding visual cues like color coding. While Kimi 1.5 with vision capabilities performed better than Kimi 2 in explaining a figure, it still made an incorrect assertion about model performance. Furthermore, Kimi's derivations, especially in Question 4, were criticized for being formulaic, substituting identities without providing underlying reasoning, which hinders the student's ability to generalize the concepts. Question 5 revealed a curious behavior: Kimi was not only clear but also assertively wrong about a specific numerical detail (loadmems), a mistake it persisted with. This assertiveness in the face of error is a notable concern. Overall, Kimi's performance indicates a strong foundation in symbolic manipulation but a lack of sophistication in visual comprehension, contextual reasoning, and adaptability to feedback, along with stylistic inconsistencies."

The student observed that even with targeted prompt engineering, Deepseek frequently omits crucial derivation steps and fails to offer detailed justifications for its solutions.  A primary concern is the model's 'one-shot' answering style. This approach, while potentially adequate for simpler problems, proves detrimental in more complex scenarios, as it hinders the identification and correction of errors.  This is concretely illustrated by the model's inability to consider multiple cases for a single question, leading to incomplete or incorrect solutions.  On a positive note, the student did not encounter any instances of hallucination, which is a significant strength. However, the overall effectiveness of the LLM for educational purposes is hampered by its superficial explanations and the risks associated with its deterministic, non-iterative problem-solving approach."

      "detailed_analysis": "Grok demonstrated a commendable level of performance on the non-coding portions of HW3, achieving a strong one-shot success rate of 70-80%. The student's experience underscored the significant positive impact of providing hints, noting that they 'almost always led to a correct answer.' This suggests that while Grok possesses inherent reasoning capabilities, explicit guidance greatly enhances its accuracy and reliability. The observation that Grok could still succeed on questions like 4C and 4D without hints further supports its independent reasoning potential.  However, the LLM's strengths were tempered by notable weaknesses. Its tendency to generate overly long and verbose responses, often spanning several pages, was a recurring issue, particularly when the student requested additional details or asked multiple follow-up questions. This verbosity, coupled with 'occasional hallucinations,' implies that while Grok could be informative, its output required careful scrutiny and distillation.  An interesting behavior was Grok's apparent capacity to 'learn' from conversational feedback, adjusting its approach. While this responsiveness is a strength, it also contributed to its tendency to 'overextend' or deviate from the original question's scope. The striking example of Grok spending 'over seven minutes thinking about an answer before I had even formally asked the question' illustrates this proactive, albeit sometimes misdirected, problem-solving approach. The LLM's responsiveness to interaction was a double-edged sword, leading to both improved performance and occasional loss of focus, making its responses 'less relevant or harder to parse' in complex conversational threads. Overall, Grok proved to be a highly capable tool for this homework, but its effectiveness was contingent on the student's ability to strategically prompt and moderate its output due to its inherent tendencies towards verbosity and sometimes unfocused ambition."

The LLM demonstrated a strong 'one-shot' capability for a majority of the problems, suggesting it has a robust knowledge base and can efficiently identify solution patterns for many standard questions. Strengths include providing complete solutions for straightforward theoretical and applied problems across various sections, such as optimization and regularization. However, its performance degraded significantly when faced with complex mathematical derivations, precise numerical computations (like eigenvalues and discriminants), and problems requiring strict adherence to specific mathematical forms or constraints.  For instance, in Problem 3c, the LLM struggled to compute fundamental mathematical values even after a prolonged search and failed to correct itself even when provided with the correct inputs.  Furthermore, the LLM exhibited a tendency to omit essential components like learning rates or specific norms in its derivations (Problems 2h, 2i), requiring multiple prompts to rectify.  Its explanations, while sometimes insightful (e.g., the 'convenience factor' for the 1/2 in loss functions), could also be misleading or indicate a superficial understanding when it failed to produce correct results or acknowledge errors. The student's repeated efforts to guide the LLM, including providing correct answers and asking it to work backward, highlight the model's resistance to correction and its reliance on its initial processing pipeline, even when flawed."

      "detailed_analysis": "Grok's performance on HW2 presents a mixed picture. For straightforward questions like Q1a, Q2, and Q5, it exhibited strong one-shot capabilities, accurately solving the problems with minimal or no prompting. This indicates a good general understanding of common problem types and an ability to process clear textual input.  However, Q1b revealed significant limitations.  The LLM's initial misinterpretation of the infinity norm as squared, stemming from PDF formatting issues, is a critical weakness.  While it could eventually identify sign SGD, its reasoning was flawed.  The iterative prompting required to correct Grok, including the student's direct intervention to steer its thought process, highlights the LLM's reliance on explicit guidance for complex mathematical tasks.  The LLM's tendency to revert to incorrect interpretations (e.g., the squared norm) and its struggle to consistently apply the correct definition even after correction are concerning.  Furthermore, the student notes that Grok's final, correct answer for Q1b, while accurate, was reached through a different thought process than what was taught in class, raising questions about the educational value and transferability of the LLM's solutions.  The difficulty with parsing information from a screenshot in Q5, compared to its success with transcribed text, points to limitations in its multimodal understanding or the specific implementation of image processing for context.  Overall, Grok shows promise for rapid problem-solving on well-defined tasks but requires significant user supervision and correction for nuanced or complex academic problems, particularly those with intricate mathematical definitions or unusual input formats."
