  },
  "Claude": {
    "1": "Claude provided very verbose explanations. While accurate, the length made it difficult to find the specific answer key.",
    "2": "Struggled with the mathematical proofs in Question 3, but the programming section was flawless."
  },
  "Gemini": {
    "1": "Provided the most concise solution. However, it hallucinated a library function that does not exist in the standard library.",
    "2": "Solid performance across the board. The reasoning for the algorithm selection was particularly insightful."
